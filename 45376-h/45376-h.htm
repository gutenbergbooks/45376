<h2>Author's Preface</h2>


<p>This volume is published in response to numerous requests from many
sections, and my purpose is to put in permanent and convenient form the
observations made during travels in the old world.</p>

<p>The illustrations will throw light on the subjects treated and it is believed
will add much to the interest. The photographs from which they were made
were collected at the places visited or taken by members of our party. Chapters
one to forty-six were written from time to time during the trip around the
world.</p>

<p>I was accompanied on this tour by my wife and our two younger children,
William J., Jr., and Grace, aged sixteen and fourteen years respectively. The
trip was taken for educational purposes and proved far more instructive than
we anticipated.</p>

<p>We left our home September 21, 1905, sailed from San Francisco September
27, and arrived in New York August 29, 1906&mdash;the day before the date
fixed for the home-coming reception in that city&mdash;and reached Lincoln September
5, sixteen days less than a year after our departure.</p>

<p>While most of our travel was in the North Temperate Zone, we were
below the Equator a few days in Java and above the Arctic Circle in Norway.</p>

<p>In this narrative I fear I have sacrificed literary style to conciseness, for I
have endeavored to condense and crowd into the space as much information as
possible. The statement of facts may be relied on, being based either upon
observations gathered at first hand from persons worthy to be trusted, or taken
from authoritative writings.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bryan assisted me in the collection of materials and the preparation of
the matter, and I am also indebted to the American Ambassadors, Ministers and
Consuls, as well as to the officials of the countries which were visited, for valuable
information.</p>

<p>I have included a series of articles written during a former visit to Europe
in 1902. As I have avoided in the World Tour Narratives the subjects treated
in these previous European articles, the two series are appropriately published
together.</p>

<p>All of these are published with the more pleasure because I believe they
will give the reader increased admiration for American institutions and a larger
confidence in the triumph of American Ideals.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>CROSSING THE PACIFIC&mdash;HAWAII.</h3>


<p>There is rest in an ocean voyage. The receding shores shut out the
hum of the busy world; the expanse of water soothes the eye by its very
vastness; the breaking of the waves is music to the ear and there is
medicine for the nerves in the salt sea breezes that invite to sleep. At
first one is disturbed&mdash;sometimes quite so&mdash;by the motion of the vessel,
but this passes away so completely that before many days the dipping
of the ship is really enjoyable and one finds a pleasure in
ascending the hills and descending the valleys into which the deck
sometimes seems to be converted.</p>

<p>If one has regarded the Pacific as an unknown or an untraversed
sea, the impression will be removed by a glance at a map recently published
by the United States government&mdash;a map with which every
ocean traveler should equip himself. On this map the Pacific is
covered with blue lines indicating the shortest routes of travel
between different points with the number of miles. The first thing that
strikes one is that the curved line indicating the northern route
between San Francisco and Yokohama is only 4,536 miles long, while
the apparently straight line between the two points is 4,791 miles long&mdash;the
difference being explained by the curvature of the earth,
although it is hard to believe that in following the direct line a ship
would have to climb over such a mountain range of water, so to speak,
as to make it shorter to go ten degrees north. The time between the
United States and the Japanese coast has recently been reduced to less
than eleven days, but the northern route is not so pleasant at this
season of the year, and we sailed on the Manchuria, September 27,
going some twenty degrees farther south via Honolulu. This route
covers 5,545 miles and is made in about sixteen days when the weather
is good.</p>

<p>The Manchuria is one of the leviathans of the Pacific and is owned
by Mr. Harriman, president of the Union Pacific and Southern Pacific
Railways. The ship's crew suggests the Orient, more than three-fourths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
being Chinese, all wearing the cue and the national garb.
There is also a suggestion of the Orient in the joss house and opium
den of the Chinese in the steerage.</p>

<p>In crossing the one hundred and eightieth meridian we lost a day,
and as we are going all the way around, we cannot recover it as those
can who recross the Pacific. We rose on Saturday morning, October 7,
and at nine o'clock were notified that Sunday had begun and the
remainder of the day was observed as the Sabbath (October 8).</p>

<p>According to the chart or map referred to there are three
centers of ocean traffic in the Pacific. Honolulu, the most important
of all, the Midway Islands, 1,160 miles northwest of Honolulu, and
the Samoan Islands, some twenty-two hundred miles to the south.
The Society Islands, about the same distance to the southeast of Honolulu,
and Guam, some fifteen hundred miles from the mainland of
Asia, are centers of less importance.</p>

<p>Our ship reached Honolulu early on the morning of the sixth day
out and we had breakfast on the island. The Hawaiian Islands (inhabited)
number eight and extend from the southeast to the northwest,
covering about six degrees of longitude and nearly four of latitude.
Of these eight islands, Hawaii, the southernmost one, is the largest,
having an area of 4,200 square miles and a population of nearly
fifty thousand. Hilo, its chief city, situated on the east shore, is the
second Hawaiian city of importance and contains some seven thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
inhabitants. The island of Oahu, upon which Honolulu is situated,
is third in size but contains the largest population, almost sixty
thousand, of which forty thousand dwell in or near the capital. The
islands are so small and surrounded by such an area of water as to
remind one of a toy land, and yet there are great mountains there, one
piercing the clouds at a height of 14,000 feet. Immense cane fields
stretch as far as the eye can reach, and busy people of different colors
and races make a large annual addition to our country's wealth. On
one of the islands is an active volcano which furnishes a thrilling
experience to those who are hardy enough to ascend its sides and cross
the lava lake, now grown cold, which surrounds the present crater.
Each island has one or more extinct volcanoes, one of these, called
"The Punch Bowl," being within the city limits of Honolulu. On one
of the islands is a leper colony, containing at times as many as a
thousand of the afflicted. During campaigns the spellbinders address
the voters from boats anchored at a safe distance from the shore.</p>

<p>As the Manchuria lay at anchor in the harbor all day the passengers
went ashore and, dividing into groups, inspected the various places
of interest. By the aid of a reception committee, composed of democrats,
republicans and brother Elks, we were able to crowd a great
deal of instruction and enjoyment into the ten hours which we spent
in Honolulu. We were greeted at the wharf with the usual salutation,
Aloha, a native word which means "a loving welcome," and were
decorated with garlands of flowers for the hat and neck. While these
garlands or leis (pronounced lays) are of all colors, orange is the
favorite hue, being the color of the feather cloak worn by the Hawaiian
kings and queens in olden times. The natives are a very kindly
and hospitable people, and we had an opportunity to meet some
excellent specimens of the race at the public reception and the country
residence of Mr. Damon, one of the leading bankers of the island.</p>

<p>When the islands were discovered in 1778 by Captain Cook, the
natives lived in thatched huts and were scantily clothed, after the
manner of the tropical races. They were not savages or cannibals, but
maintained a degree of civil order and had made considerable progress
in the primitive arts. In their religious rites they offered human sacrifices,
but they welcomed the white man and quickly embraced
Christianity. American influence in the islands reaches back some
seventy-five years, beginning with New England missionaries, many
of whose descendants have made permanent homes here. Some of
these, mingling their blood with the blood of the natives, form connecting
links between the old and the new civilization. Foreign ways<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and customs soon began to manifest themselves and long before annexation
the native rulers built buildings after the style of our own
architecture. The Capitol building, erected twenty years ago for the
king's palace, is an imposing structure, and the Judiciary building
is almost equal to it. The parks and public grounds are beautiful and
well kept, and the business blocks commodious and substantial. In
short, Honolulu presents the appearance of a well built, cleanly and
prosperous American city, with its residences nestling among palm
trees and tropical plants. Good hotels are abundant. The Alexander
Young hotel is built of stone imported from the States and would do
credit to a city of half a million. The Royal Hawaiian hotel, even
more picturesque, though not so large, and the Moana hotel, at the
beach, vie with the Young in popularity.</p>

<p>The program for our day's stay began with a seven mile automobile
ride to the Pali, the pass over which the natives cross to the farther
side of the island. The road is of macadam and winding along a picturesque
valley rises to a height of about 1,200 feet. At this point the
eye falls upon a picture of bewitching beauty. Just below is a
precipitous cliff over which a conquering king, Kamehameha the First,
about one hundred and ten years ago, drove an opposing army when
he established himself as ruler of the islands. To the east from the
foot of the cliff, a thousand feet down, stretches a beautiful valley with
an endless variety of verdure; and beyond, a coast line broken by
a rocky promontory, around whose base the waters reflect from their
varying depths myriad hues of blue and green. There are ocean views
of greater expanse, mountain views more sublime and agricultural
landscapes more interesting to a dweller upon prairies, but it is doubtful
whether there is anywhere upon earth a combination of mountain,
valley and ocean&mdash;a commingling of the colors of sky and sea and
rock and foliage&mdash;more entrancing. Twice on the way to Pali we
passed through mountain showers and were almost ready to turn back,
but the members of the committee, knowing of the rare treat ahead,
assured us that Hawaiian showers were of short duration and "extra
dry." When we at last beheld the view, we felt that a drenching might
gladly have been endured, so great was the reward.</p>

<p>The committee next took us by special train on the Oahu railroad to
one of the great sugar plantations of the island, a plantation outside
of the trust, owned and operated by a San Francisco company. This
company has built an immense refinery upon the plantation and the
manager showed us the process of sugar making from the crushing
of the cane to the refined product, sacked ready for shipment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">SURF-RIDING IN HAWAII.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The stalks, after passing through the mill, are dried and carried to
the furnace, thus saving some sixty-five per cent of the cost of fuel&mdash;an
important economy when it is remembered that all the fuel for
manufacturing is brought from abroad. Until recently, several hundred
thousand dollars' worth of coal was annually brought from Australia,
but California oil is now being substituted for coal. The refuse
which remains when the sugar making process is completed is returned
to the land as fertilizer. The economies effected in fuel and in fertilizer,
together with the freight saved on impurities carried in the raw
sugar, amount to a considerable sum and to this extent increase the
profit of the business. While at the sugar plantation we were shown
an immense pumping plant used in the irrigation of the land. The
water is drawn from artesian wells and forced to a height of almost
six hundred feet, in some places, and from the summits of the hills
is carried to all parts of the plantation. Some idea of the size of the
plants can be gathered from the fact that the pumps used on this
plantation have a combined capacity of sixty million gallons per day.</p>

<p>Speaking of irrigation, I am reminded that the rainfall varies greatly
in different parts of the island. At Honolulu, for instance, it is something
like thirty inches per year, while at one point within five miles
of the city the annual rainfall sometimes reaches one hundred and
forty inches. The sugar plantation visited, while one of the largest,
is only one of a number of plantations, the total sugar product of the
islands reaching about four hundred thousand tons annually.</p>

<p>Next to the sugar crops comes the rice crop, many of the rice fields<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
lying close to the city. Pineapples, bananas, coffee and cocoanuts are
also raised. Attention is being given now to the development of crops
which can be grown by small planters, those in authority recognizing
the advantage to the country of small holdings.</p>

<p>The labor problem is the most serious one which the people of
Hawaii have to meet. At present the manual labor is largely done by
Japanese, Chinese and Koreans&mdash;these together considerably outnumbering
the whites and natives. Several thousand Portuguese have been
brought to the islands and have proven an excellent addition to the
population. On the day that we were there the immigration commission
authorized the securing of a few Italian families with a view of
testing their fitness for the climate. The desire is to develop a homogeneous
population suited to the conditions and resources of the islands.</p>

<p>We returned from the sugar plantation in automobiles, stopping at
the country home of Mr. Damon, which was once a royal habitation.
The present owner has collected many relics showing the life, habits
and arts of the native Hawaiians.</p>

<p>Still nearer the town we visited two splendid schools, one for native
boys, the other for native girls, built from the funds left by native
chiefs. The boys and girls were drawn up in front of one of the
buildings and under the direction of their instructor sang the national
anthem of the natives, now preserved as the territorial hymn. They
were a finely proportioned, well dressed and intelligent group and are
said to be studious and excellently behaved. Nothing on the islands
interested us more than these native children, illustrating as they do,
not only the possibilities of their race, but the immense progress made
in a little more than a hundred years of contact with the whites. The
museum, the gift of Mr. Bishop, now of California, who married the
widow of one of the native chiefs, is said to contain the best collection
of the handiwork of the natives of the Pacific Islands to be found anywhere.</p>

<p>The public reception at the Royal Hawaiian hotel gave us an opportunity
to meet not only the prominent American and native citizens
and their wives, but a large number of the artisans and laborers of the
various races, and we were pleased to note throughout the day the harmonious
feeling which exists between the whites and the brown population.</p>

<p>Political convictions produce the same results here as in the United
States, sometimes dividing families. For instance, Prince Cupid, the
present territorial representative in congress, is a republican, while his
brother, Prince David, is an enthusiastic democrat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a><br /><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
The luncheon prepared by the committee included a number of
native dishes cooked according to the recipes which were followed for
hundreds of years before the white man set foot upon the island. The
health of the guests was drunk in cocoanut water, a nut full of which
stood at each plate. Poi, the staple food of the natives, was present in
abundance. This is made from a root or tuber known as taro, which
grows in swamps and has a leaf resembling our plant, commonly known
as elephant's ear. This tuber is ground to a pulp resembling paste and
is served in polished wooden bowls, in the making of which the natives
exhibit great skill. Next in interest came the fish and chicken, wrapped
in the leaves of a plant called ti (pronounced like tea) and cooked
underground by means of hot stones. The flavor of food thus cooked
is excellent. The crowning glory of the feast was a roasted pig, also
cooked underground&mdash;and a toothsome dish it was. Besides these, there
were bread fruit, alligator pears and delicacies made from the meat
of the cocoanut. The salt, a native product, was salmon colored. The
invited guests were about equally divided between the American and
native population. But for the elegant surroundings of the Young
hotel, the beautifully appointed table and the modern dress, it was such
a dinner as might have been served by the natives to the whites on
the first Thanksgiving after the New England missionaries landed.</p>

</div>

<p>After a call upon Governor Carter, a descendant of the third generation
from missionary stock, we visited the aquarium. When we
noticed on the printed program that we were scheduled for a visit to
this place, it did not impress us as possessing special interest, but we
had not been in the building long before we were all roaring with
laughter at the remarkable specimens of the finny tribe here collected.</p>

<p>Language can not do this subject justice. No words can accurately
portray what one here sees. The fish are odd in shape and have all the
hues of the rainbow. The tints are laid on as if with a brush and
yet no painter could imitate these&mdash;shall we call them "pictures in water
color?" Some were long and slim; some short and thick. One had a
forehead like a wedge, another had a very blunt nose. Some looked
like thin slabs of pearl with iridescent tints; others had quills like a
porcupine. One otherwise respectable looking little fellow had a long
nose upon the end of which was a fiery glow which made him look
like an old toper; another of a deep peacock blue had a nose for all
the world like a stick of indigo which it wiggled as it swam.</p>

<p>There were convict fish with stripes like those worn in penitentiaries
and of these there were all sizes; some moving about slowly and solemnly
like hardened criminals and others sporting about as if enjoying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
their first taste of wrongdoing. One variety wore what looked like an
orange colored ribbon tied just above the tail; the color was so like
the popular flower of Hawaii that we were not surprised to find that
the fish was called the lei. In one tank the fish had a habit of resting
upon the rocks; they would brace themselves with their fins and watch
the passersby. At one time two were perched side by side and recalled
the familiar picture of Raphael's Cherubs. Besides the fishes there were
crabs of several varieties, all brilliant in color; one called the hermit
crab had a covering like velvet, with as delicate a pattern as ever came
from the loom. And, then, there was the octopus with the under side
of its arms lined with valve-like mouths. It was hiding under the
rocks, and when the attendant poked it out with a stick, it darkened
the water with an inky fluid, recalling the use made of the subsidized
American newspapers by the trust when attacked.</p>

<p>No visitor to Honolulu should fail to see the aquarium. Every effort
to transport these fish has thus far failed. To enjoy the dudes, clowns
and criminals of fishdom one must see them in their native waters.</p>

<p>The tour of the island closed with a trip to the beach and a ride in
the surf boats. The native boat is a long, narrow, deep canoe steadied
by a log fastened at both ends to the boat and floating about ten feet
from the side. These canoes will hold six or seven persons and are
propelled by brawny-armed natives. Our party clad themselves in
bathing suits and, filling three canoes, were rowed out some distance
from the shore. The natives, expert at this sport, watch for a large wave
and signal each other when they see one approaching, and then with
their big round paddles they start their canoes toward the land. As
the wave raises the stern of the canoe, they bend to their work, the
purpose being to keep the canoe on the forward slope of the wave. It
is an exciting experience to ride thus, with the spray breaking over
one while the canoe flies along before the wave. Sometimes the boatmen
are too slow and the wave sweeps under the canoe and is gone,
but as a rule they know just how fast to work, and there is great
rivalry between the surf riders when two or more crews are racing. It
is strange that a form of sport so delightful has not been transported
to the American seaside resorts. There is surf bathing the year round
at Honolulu and few beaches can be found which can compare with
Waikiki.</p>

<p>The Oahu railroad, which carried us out to the sugar plantation,
and which has seventy miles of track on the island, passes within sight
of the Pearl harbor, which is the only large inlet in the islands capable
of being developed into a harbor. The United States government is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
already dredging this harbor and preparing it for both naval and commercial
uses. The Hawaiian Islands occupy a strategic position as well
as a position of great commercial importance, and as they are on a direct
line between the Isthmus of Panama and the Orient, their value as a
mid-ocean stopping place will immeasurably increase. The islands
being now United States territory, the advantage of the possession of
Pearl harbor is accompanied by a responsibility for its proper improvement.
No one can visit the harbor without appreciating its importance
to our country and to the world.</p>

<p>When we departed from the wharf at nightfall to board the Manchuria
we were again laden with flowers, and as we left the island, refreshed
by the perfume of flowers and cheered by songs and farewells,
we bore away grateful memories of the day and of the hospitality of
the people. Like all who see this Pacific paradise, we resolved to
return sometime and spend a part of a winter amid its beauties.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>JAPAN AND HER PEOPLE.</h3>


<p>The eyes of the world are on Japan. No other nation has ever
made such progress in the same length of time, and at no time in her
history has Japan enjoyed greater prestige than she enjoys just now;
and, it may be added, at no time has she had to face greater problems
than those which now confront her.</p>

<p>We were fortunate in the time of our arrival. Baron Komura, the
returning peace commissioner, returned two days later; the naval review
celebrating the new Anglo-Japanese alliance took place in Yokohama
harbor a week afterward, and this was followed next day by the
reception of Admiral Togo at Tokyo. These were important events
and they gave a visitor an extraordinary opportunity to see the people
en masse. In this article I shall deal in a general way with Japan
and her people, leaving for future articles her history, her government,
her politics, her industries, her art, her education and her religions.</p>

<p>The term Japan is a collective title applied to four large islands, that
is, Honshiu, Kyushu, Shikoku, Hokkaido and about six hundred
smaller ones. Formosa and the islands immediately adjoining it are
not generally included, although since the Chinese war they belong
to Japan.</p>

<p>Japan extends in the shape of a crescent, curving toward the northeast,
from fifty north latitude and one hundred and fifty-six east longitude
to twenty-one degrees north latitude and one hundred and nineteen
east longitude. The area is a little less than one hundred and sixty
thousand square miles, more than half of which is on the island
of Honshiu. The coast line is broken by numerous bays furnishing
commodious harbors, the most important of which are at Yokohama,
Osaka, Kobe, Nagasaki, Kagoshima and Hakodate. The islands are
so mountainous that only about one-twelfth the area is capable of
cultivation. Although Formosa has a mountain, Mt. Niitaka (sometimes
called Mt. Morrison) which is two thousand feet higher,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Fujiyama is the highest mountain in Japan proper. It reaches a height
of 12,365 feet.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="view" id="view"></a>
<img src="images/ill007.jpg" width="450" height="398" alt="view" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">A PICTURESQUE VIEW.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Fuji (Yama is the Japanese word for mountain) is called the Sacred
Mountain and is an object of veneration among the Japanese. And
well it may be, for it is doubtful if there is on earth a more symmetrical
mountain approaching it in height. Rising in the shape of a
perfect cone, with its summit crowned with snow throughout nearly the
entire year and visible from sea level, it is one of the most sublime
of all the works of nature. Mt. Ranier, as they say at Seattle, or
Tacoma, as it is called in the city of that name, and Popocatapetl, near
Mexico's capital, are the nearest approach to Fuji, so far as the writer's
observation goes. Pictures of Fuji are to be found on everything; they
are painted on silk, embroidered on screens, worked on velvet, carved
in wood and wrought in bronze and stone. We saw it from Lake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Hakone, a beautiful sheet of water some three thousand feet above the
ocean. The foot hills which surround the lake seem to open at one
point in order to give a more extended view of the sloping sides of this
sleeping giant.</p>

<p>And speaking of Hakone, it is one of the beauty spots of Japan.
On an island in this lake is the summer home of the crown prince.
Hakone is reached by a six-mile ride from Miyanoshita, a picturesque
little village some sixty miles west of Yokohama. There are here hot
springs and all the delights of a mountain retreat. One of the best
modern hotels in Japan, the Fujiya, is located here, and one of its
earliest guests was General Grant when he made his famous tour around
the world. The road from the hotel to Hakone leads by foaming
mountain streams, through closely cultivated valleys and over a range
from which the coast line can be seen.</p>

<p>Nikko, about a hundred miles north of Tokyo, and Nara about thirty
miles from Kyoto, are also noted for their natural scenery, but as these
places are even more renowned because of the temples located there
they will be described later. The inland sea which separates the larger
islands of Japan, and is itself studded with smaller islands, adds interest
to the travel from port to port. Many of these islands are inhabited,
and the tiny fields which perch upon their sides give evidence of an
ever present thrift. Some of the islands are barren peaks jutting a few
hundred feet above the waves, while some are so small as to look like
hay stacks in a submerged meadow.</p>

<p>All over Japan one is impressed with the patient industry of the
people. If the Hollanders have reclaimed the ocean's bed, the people
of Japan have encroached upon the mountains. They have broadened
the valleys and terraced the hill sides. Often the diminutive fields are
held in place by stone walls, while the different levels are furnished
with an abundance of water from the short but numerous rivers.</p>

<p>The climate is very much diversified, ranging from almost tropical
heat in Formosa to arctic cold in the northern islands; thus Japan can
produce almost every kind of food. Her population in 1903 was estimated
at nearly forty-seven millions, an increase of about thirteen
and a half millions since 1873. While Tokyo has a population of
about one and a half millions, Osaka a population of nearly a million,
Kyoto three hundred and fifty thousand, Yokohama three hundred
thousand, and Kobe and Nagoya about the same, and there are several
other large cities of less size, still a large majority of the population is
rural and the farming communities have a decided preponderance in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the federal congress, or diet. The population, however, is increasing
more rapidly in the cities than in the country.</p>

<p>The stature of the Japanese is below that of the citizens of the
United States and northern Europe. The average height of the men
in the army is about five feet two inches, and the average weight between
a hundred and twenty and a hundred and thirty pounds. It
looks like burlesque opera to see, as one does occasionally, two or three
little Japanese soldiers guarding a group of big burly Russian prisoners.</p>

<p>The opinion is quite general that the habit which the Japanese form
from infancy of sitting on the floor with their feet under them, tends
to shorten the lower limbs. In all the schools the children are now
required to sit upon benches and whether from this cause or some other,
the average height of the males, as shown by yearly medical examination,
is gradually increasing. Although undersize, the people are
sturdy and muscular and have the appearance of robust health. In
color they display all shades of brown, from a very light to a very
dark. While the oblique eye is common, it is by no means universal.</p>

<p>The conveyance which is most popular is the jinrikisha, a narrow
seated, two wheeled top buggy with shafts, joined with a cross piece
at the end. These are drawn by "rikisha men" of whom there are
several hundred thousand in the empire. The 'rikisha was invented
by a Methodist missionary some thirty years ago and at once sprang
into popularity. When the passenger is much above average weight,
or when the journey is over a hilly road, a pusher is employed and in
extraordinary cases two pushers. It is astonishing what speed these
men can make. One of the governors informed me that 'rikisha men
sometimes cover seventy-five miles of level road in a day. They will
take up a slow trot and travel for several miles without a break. We
had occasion to go to a village fifteen miles from Kagoshima and
crossed a low mountain range of perhaps two thousand feet. The trip
each way occupied about four hours; each 'rikisha had two pushers
and the men had three hours rest at noon. They felt so fresh at the
end of the trip that they came an hour later to take us to a dinner
engagement. In the mountainous regions the chair and kago take the
place of the 'rikisha. The chair rests on two bamboo poles and is carried
by four men; the kago is suspended from one pole, like a swinging
hammock, and is carried by two. Of the two, the chair is much the
more comfortable for the tourist. The basha is a small one-horse omnibus
which will hold four or six small people; it is used as a sort of stage
between villages. A large part of the hauling of merchandise is done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a><br /><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
by men, horses being rarely seen. In fact, in some of the cities there
are more oxen than horses, and many of them wear straw sandals to
protect their hoofs from the hard pavement. The lighter burdens are
carried in buckets or baskets, suspended from the ends of a pole and
balanced upon the shoulder.</p>

</div>

<p>In the country the demand for land is so great that most of the roads
are too narrow for any other vehicle than a hand cart. The highways
connecting the cities and principal towns, however, are of good width,
are substantially constructed and well drained, and have massive stone
bridges spanning the streams.</p>

<p>The clothing of the men presents an interesting variety. In official
circles the European and American dress prevails. The silk hat and
Prince Albert coat are in evidence at all day functions, and the dress
suit at evening parties. The western style of dress is also worn by many
business men, professional men and soldiers, and by students after they
reach the middle school, which corresponds to our high school. The
change is taking place more rapidly among the young than among the
adults and is more marked in the city than in the country. In one of
the primary schools in Kyoto, I noticed that more than half of the children
gave evidence of the transition in dress. The change is also more
noticeable in the seaport cities than in the interior. At Kyoto, an inland
city, the audience wore the native dress and all were seated on
mats on the floor, while the next night at Osaka, a seaport, all sat
on chairs and nearly all wore the American dress. At the Osaka
meeting some forty Japanese young ladies from the Congregational
college sang "My Country 'Tis of Thee" in English.</p>

<p>The shopkeepers and clerks generally wear the native clothing,
which consists of a divided skirt and a short kimono held in place by
a sash. The laboring men wear loose knee breeches and a shirt in
warm weather; in cold weather they wear tight fitting breeches that
reach to the ankles and a loose coat. In the country the summer
clothing is even more scanty. I saw a number of men working in
the field with nothing on but a cloth about the loins, and it was
early in November, when I found a light overcoat comfortable.</p>

<p>A pipe in a wooden case and a tobacco pouch are often carried in
the belt or sash, for smoking is almost universal among both men and
women.</p>

<p>Considerable latitude is allowed in footwear. The leather shoe has
kept pace with the coat and vest, but where the native dress is worn,
the sandal is almost always used. Among the well-to-do the foot is
encased in a short sock made of white cotton cloth, which is kep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>t
scrupulously clean. The sock has a separate division for the great
toe, the sandal being held upon the foot by a cord which runs between
the first and second toes and, dividing, fastens on each side
of the sandal. These sandals are of wood and rest upon two blocks
an inch or more high, the front one sloping toward the toe. The
sandal hangs loosely upon the foot and drags upon the pavement
with each step. The noise made by a crowd at a railroad station
rises above the roar of the train. In muddy weather a higher sandal
is used which raises the feet three or four inches from the ground,
and the wearers stalk about as if on stilts. The day laborers wear
a cheaper sandal made of woven rope or straw. The footwear above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
described comes down from time immemorial, but there is coming
into use among the 'rikisha men a modern kind of footwear which
is a compromise between the new and the old. It is a dark cloth,
low-topped gaiter with a rubber sole and no heel. These have the
separate pocket for the great toe. The sandals are left at the door.
At public meetings in Japanese halls the same custom is followed,
the sandals being checked at the door as hats and wraps are in our
country. On approaching a meeting place the speaker can form
some estimate of the size of the audience by the size of the piles of
sandals on the outside. After taking cold twice, I procured a pair
of felt slippers and carried them with me, and the other members of
the family did likewise.</p>

</div>

<p>The women still retain the primitive dress. About 1884 an attempt
was made by the ladies of the court to adopt the European
dress and quite a number of women in official circles purchased gowns
in London, Paris and the United States, in spite of the protests of
their sisters abroad. (Mrs. Cleveland joined in a written remonstrance
which was sent from the United States.) But the spell was
broken in a very few months and the women outside of the court
circles returned to the simpler and more becoming native garb. It
is not necessary to enter into details regarding the female toilet, as
the magazines have made the world familiar with the wide sleeved,
loose fitting kimono with its convenient pockets. The children wear
bright colors, but the adults adopt more quiet shades.</p>

<p>The shape of the garment never changes, but the color does. This
season grey has been the correct shade. Feminine pride shows itself
in the obi, a broad sash or belt tied in a very stiff and incomprehensible
bow at the back. The material used for the obi is often bright
in color and of rich and expensive brocades. A wooden disc is often
concealed within the bow of the obi to keep it in shape and also to
brace the back. Two neck cloths are usually worn, folded inside the
kimono to protect the bare throat. These harmonize with the obi
in color and give a dainty finish to the costume. As the kimono is
quite narrow in the skirt, the women take very short steps. This
short step, coupled with the dragging of the sandals, makes the
women's gait quite unlike the free stride of the American woman.
In the middle and higher schools the girls wear a pleated skirt over
the kimono. These are uniform for each school and wine color is
the shade now prevailing. The men and women of the same class
wear practically the same kind of shoes.</p>

<p>Next to the obi, the hair receives the greatest attention and it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
certainly arranged with elaborate care. The process is so complicated
that a hair dresser is employed once or twice a week and beetle's
oil is used in many instances to make the hair smooth and glossy. At
night the Japanese women place a very hard, round cushion under
the neck in order to keep the hair from becoming disarranged. The
stores now have on sale air pillows, which are more comfortable than
the wooden ones formerly used. The vexing question of millinery
is settled by dispensing with hats entirely. Among the poorer classes
the hat is seldom used by the men.</p>

<p>More interesting in appearance than either the men or women are
the children&mdash;and I may add that there is no evidence of race suicide
in Japan. They are to be seen everywhere, and a good natured lot
they are. The babies are carried on the back of the mother or an
older child, and it is not unusual to see the baby fast asleep while
the bearer goes about her work. Of the tens of thousands of babies
we have seen, scarcely a half dozen have been crying. The younger
children sometimes have the lower part of the head shaved, leaving
a cap of long hair on the crown of the head. Occasionally a spot is
shaved in the center of this cap. After seeing the children on the
streets, one can better appreciate the Japanese dolls, which look so
strange to American children.</p>

<p>Cleanliness is the passion of the Japanese. The daily bath is a
matter of routine, and among the middle classes there are probably
more who go above this average than below. It is said that in the
city of Tokyo there are over eleven hundred public baths, and it is
estimated that five hundred thousand baths are taken daily at these
places. The usual charge is one and a quarter cents (in our money)
for adults and one cent for children. One enthusiastic admirer of
Japan declares that a Japanese boy, coming unexpectedly into the
possession of a few cents, will be more apt to spend it on a bath
than on something to eat or drink. The private houses have baths
wherever the owners can afford them. The bath tub is made like
a barrel&mdash;sometimes of stone, but more often of wood&mdash;and is sunk
below the level of the floor. The favorite temperature is one hundred
and ten degrees, and in the winter time the bath tub often takes the
place of a stove. In fact, at the hot springs people have been known
to remain in the bath for days at a time. I do not vouch for
the statement, but Mr. Basil H. Chamberlain in his book entitled
"Things Japanese," says that when he was at one of these hot springs
"the caretaker of the establishment, a hale old man of eighty, used
to stay in the bath during the entire winter." Until recently the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
men and women bathed promiscuously in the public baths; occasionally,
but not always, a string separated the bathers. Now different
apartments must be provided.</p>

<p>The Japanese are a very polite people. They have often been
likened to the French in this respect&mdash;the French done in bronze,
so to speak. They bow very low, and in exchanging salutations and
farewells sometimes bow several times. When the parties are seated
on the floor, they rise to the knees and bow the head to the floor.
Servants, when they bring food to those who are seated on the floor,
drop upon their knees and, bowing, present the tray.</p>

<p>In speaking of the people I desire to emphasize one conclusion that
has been drawn from my observations here, viz., that I have never
seen a more quiet, orderly or self-restrained people. I have visited
all of the larger cities and several of the smaller ones, in all parts
of the islands; have mingled in the crowds that assembled at Tokyo
and at Yokohama at the time of the reception to Togo and during
the naval review; have ridden through the streets in day time and
at night; and have walked when the entire street was a mass of
humanity. I have not seen one drunken native or witnessed a fight
or altercation of any kind. This is the more remarkable when it
is remembered that these have been gala days when the entire population
turned out to display its patriotism and to enjoy a vacation.</p>

<p>The Japanese house deserves a somewhat extended description. It
is built of wood, is one story in height, unpainted and has a thatched
or a tile roof. The thatched roof is cheaper, but far less durable.
Some of the temples and palaces have a roof constructed like a
thatched roof in which the bark of the arbor vitæ is used in place
of grass or straw. These roofs are often a foot thick and are quite
imposing. In cities most buildings are roofed with tile of a pattern
which has been used for hundreds of years. Shingles are sometimes
used on newer structures, but they are not nearly so large as our
shingles, and instead of being fastened with nails, are held in place
by wire. On the business streets the houses are generally two stories,
the merchant living above the store. The public buildings are now
being constructed of brick and stone and modeled after the buildings
of America and Europe. But returning to the native architecture&mdash;the
house is really little more than a frame, for the dividing
walls are sliding screens, and, except in cold weather, the outside
walls are taken out during the day. The rooms open into each other,
the hallway extending around the outside instead of going through
the center. Frail sliding partitions covered with paper separate the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
rooms from the hall, glass being almost unknown. The floor is covered
with a heavy matting two inches thick, and as these mats are
of uniform size, six feet by three, the rooms are made to fit the mats,
twelve feet square being the common size. As the walls of the room
are not stationary, there is no place for the hanging of pictures,
although the sliding walls are often richly decorated. Such pictures
as the house contains are painted on silk or paper and are rolled up
when not on exhibition. At one end of the room used for company,
there is generally a raised platform upon which a pot of flowers or
other ornament is placed, and above this there are one or two shelves,
the upper one being inclosed in sliding doors. There are no bedsteads,
the beds being made upon the floor and rolled up during the
day. There are no tables or chairs. There is usually a diminutive
desk about a foot high upon which writing material is placed. The
writing is done with a brush and the writing case or box containing
the brush, ink, etc., has furnished the lacquer industry with one of
the most popular articles for ornamentation. The people sit upon
cushions upon the floor and their meals are served upon trays.</p>

<p>Japanese food is so different from American food that it takes the
visitor some time to acquire a fondness for it, more time than the
tourist usually has at his disposal. With the masses rice is the staple
article of diet, and it is the most palatable native dish that the foreigner
finds here. The white rice raised in Japan is superior in
quality to some of the rice raised in China, and the farmers are
often compelled to sell good rice and buy the poorer quality. Millet,
which is even cheaper, is used as a substitute for rice.</p>

<p>As might be expected in a seagirt land, fish, lobster, crab, shrimp,
etc., take the place of meat, the fish being often served raw. As a
matter of fact, it is sometimes brought to the table alive and carved
in the presence of the guests. Sweet potatoes, pickled radishes, mushrooms,
sea weed, barley and fruit give variety to the diet. The radishes
are white and enormous in size. I saw some which were two
feet long and two and a half inches in diameter. Another variety
is conical in form and six or eight inches in diameter. I heard of
a kind of turnip which grows so large that two of them make a load
for the small Japanese horses. The chicken is found quite generally
throughout the country, but is small like the fighting breeds or the
Leghorns. Ducks, also, are plentiful. Milk is seldom used except in
case of sickness, and butter is almost unknown among the masses.</p>

<p>But the subject of food led me away from the house. No description
would be complete which did not mention the little gate through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
which the tiny door yard is entered; the low doorway upon which
the foreigner constantly bumps his head, and the little garden at the
rear of the house with its fish pond, its miniature mountains, its
climbing vines and fragrant flowers. The dwarf trees are cultivated
here, and they are a delight to the eye; gnarled and knotted pines
two feet high and thirty or forty years old are not uncommon. Little
maple trees are seen here fifty years old and looking all of their age,
but only twelve inches in height. We saw a collection of these dwarf
trees, several hundred in number, and one could almost imagine
himself transported to the home of the brownies. Some of these
trees bear fruit ludicrously large for the size of the tree. The houses
are heated by charcoal fires in open urns or braziers, but an American
would not be satisfied with the amount of heat supplied. These
braziers are moved about the room as convenience requires and supply
heat for the inevitable tea.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>JAPANESE CUSTOMS AND HOSPITALITY.</h3>


<p>Every nation has its customs, its way of doing things, and a nation's
customs and ways are likely to be peculiar in proportion as the nation
is isolated. In Japan, therefore, one would expect to see many strange
things, and the expectation is more than realized. In some things
their customs are exactly the opposite of ours. In writing they place
their characters in vertical lines and move from right to left, while
our letters are arranged on horizontal lines and read from left to
right. Their books begin where ours end and end where ours begin.
The Japanese carpenters pull the saw and plane toward them, while
ours push them from them. The Japanese mounts his steed from
the right, while the American mounts from the left; Japanese turn
to the left, Americans to the right. Japanese write it "Smith John
Mr.," while we say "Mr. John Smith." At dinners in Japan wine
is served hot and soup cold, and the yard is generally at the back
of the house instead of the front.</p>

<p>The Japanese wear white for mourning and often bury their dead
in a sitting posture. The death is sometimes announced as occurring
at the house when it actually occurred elsewhere, and the date of the
death is fixed to suit the convenience of the family. This is partly
due to the fact that the Japanese like to have the death appear as
occurring at home. Sometimes funeral services are held over a part
of the body. An American lady whose Japanese maid died while
attending her mistress in the United States, reports an incident worth
relating. The lady cabled her husband asking instructions in regard
to the disposition of the body. He conferred with the family of the
deceased and cabled back directing the wife to bring a lock of the hair
and the false teeth of the departed. The instructions were followed
and upon the delivery of these precious relics, they were interred
with the usual ceremonies.</p>

<p>The handshake is uncommon even among Japanese politicians,
except in their intercourse with foreigners. When Baron Komura<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
returned from the peace conference in which he played so important
a part, I was anxious to witness his landing, partly out of respect to
the man and partly out of curiosity to see whether the threatened
manifestations of disapproval would be made by the populace, it having
been rumored that thousands of death lanterns were being prepared
for a hostile parade. (It is needless to say that the threats did
not materialize and that no expressions of disapproval were heard
after his arrival.) I found it impossible to learn either the hour or
the landing place, and, despairing of being present, started to visit
a furniture factory to inspect some wood carving. Consul-General
Jones of Dalney (near Port Arthur), then visiting in Yokohama,
was my escort and, as good fortune would have it, we passed near the
Detached Palace. Dr. Jones, hearing that the landing might be made
there, obtained permission for us to await the peace commissioner's
coming. We found Marquis Ito there and a half dozen other officials.
As Baron Komura did not arrive for half an hour, it gave me the
best opportunity that I could have had to become acquainted with the
Marquis, who is the most influential man in Japan at present. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
is President of the Privy Council of Elder Statesmen and is credited
with being the most potent factor in the shaping of Japan's demands
at Portsmouth.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="geisha" id="geisha"></a>
<img src="images/ill011.jpg" width="400" height="305" alt="geisha" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">JAPANESE GEISHA GIRLS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>When Baron Komura stepped from the launch upon the soil of
his native land, he was met by Marquis Ito, and each greeted the
other with a low bow. The baron then saluted the other officials in
the same manner and, turning, bowed to a group of Japanese ladies
representing the Woman's Patriotic Association. Dr. Jones and I stood
some feet in the rear of the officials and were greeted by the baron
after he had saluted his own countrymen. He extended his hand to
us. The incident is mentioned as illustrating the difference in the
manner of greeting. For who would be more apt to clasp hands,
if that were customary, than these two distinguished statesmen whose
personalities are indissolubly linked together in the conclusion of a
world renowned treaty?</p>

<p>A brief account of the reception of Admiral Togo may be interesting
to those who read this article. While at Tokyo I visited the
city hall, at the invitation of the mayor and city council. While
there Mayor Ozaki informed me that he, in company with the mayors
of the other cities, would tender Admiral Togo a reception on the
following Tuesday, and invited me to be present. Of course I accepted,
because it afforded a rare opportunity to observe Japanese customs
as well as to see a large concourse of people. As I witnessed
the naval review in Yokohama the day before and the illumination
at night, I did not reach Tokyo until the morning of the reception,
and this led me into considerable embarrassment. On the train I
met a Japanese gentleman who could speak English. He was kind
enough to find me a 'rikisha man and a pusher and to instruct them
to take me at once to Uyeno Park. He then left me and the 'rikisha
men followed his instructions to the letter. They had not proceeded
far when I discovered that Admiral Togo had arrived on the same
train and that a long procession had formed to conduct him to the
park. Before I knew it, I was whisked past an escort of distinguished
citizens who, clad in Prince Alberts and silk hats, followed the carriages,
and then I found my 'rikisha drawn into an open space
between two carriages. Grabbing the 'rikisha man in front of me, I
told him by word and gesture to get out of the line of the procession.
He could not understand English, and evidently thinking that I
wanted to get nearer the front, he ran past a few carriages and then
dropped into another opening. Again I got him out of the line,
employing more emphasis than before, only to be carried still nearer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
the front. After repeated changes of position, all the time employing
such sign language as I could command and attempting to convey by
different tones of voice suggestions that I could not translate into
language, I at last reached the head of the procession. And the
'rikisha men, as if satisfied with the success of their efforts, paused
to await the starting of the line. I tried to inform them that I was
not a part of the procession; that I wanted to get on another street;
that they should take me to the park by some other route and do so
at once. They at last comprehended sufficiently to leave the carriages
and take up a rapid gait, but get off of the street they would not. For
three miles they drew me between two rows of expectant people, whose
eyes peered down the street to catch a glimpse of the great admiral,
who, as the commander of the Japanese navy, has won such signal
victories over the Russians. I saw a million people; they represented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
every class, age and condition. I saw more people than I ever saw
before in a single day. Old men and old women, feeble, but strengthened
by their enthusiasm; middle aged men and women whose sons
had shared in the dangers and in the triumphs of the navy; students
from the boys' schools and students from the girls' schools with flags
and banners, little children dressed in all the colors of the rainbow&mdash;all
were there. And I could imagine that each one of them old
enough to think, was wondering why a foreigner was intruding upon
a street which the police had cleared for a triumphal procession. If
some one had angrily caught my 'rikisha men and thrust them
through the crowd to a side street I should not have complained&mdash;I
would even have felt relieved, but no one molested them or me and
I reached the park some minutes ahead of the admiral. How glad
I was to alight, and how willingly I rewarded the smiles of the 'rikisha
men with a bonus&mdash;for had they not done their duty as they understood
it? And had they not also given me, in spite of my protests,
such a view of the people of Tokyo as I could have obtained in no
other way?</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="yukio" id="yukio"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">YUKIO OZAKI&mdash;MAYOR OF TOKYO</p></div>
</div>

<p>At the park I luckily fell in with some of the councilmen whom
I had met before and they took me in hand. I saw the procession
arrive, heard the banzais (the Japanese cheers) as they rolled along
the street, keeping pace with Togo's carriage, and I witnessed the
earnest, yet always orderly, rejoicing of the crowd that had congregated
at the end of the route. When the procession passed by
us into the park the members of the city council fell in behind the
carriages, and I with them. When we reached the stand, a seat was
tendered me on the front row from which the extraordinary ceremonies
attending the reception could be witnessed. Mayor Ozaki, the
presiding officer, escorted Admiral Togo to a raised platform, and
there the two took seats on little camp stools some ten feet apart, facing
each other, with their sides to the audience and to those on the stand.
After a moment's delay, a priest, clad in his official robes, approached
with cake and a teacup on a tray and, kneeling, placed them before
the admiral. Tea was then brought in a long handled pot and poured
into the cup. After the distinguished guest had partaken of these
refreshments, the mayor arose and read an address of welcome. He
has the reputation of being one of the best orators in the empire, and
his part was doubly interesting to me. As he confined himself to his
manuscript, I could not judge of his delivery, but his voice was pleasing
and his manner natural. The address recited the exploits of Admiral
Togo and gave expression to the gratitude of the people. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
its conclusion the hero-admiral arose and modestly acknowledged the
compliment paid to him and to his officers. Admiral Togo is short,
even for the Japanese, and has a scanty beard. Neither in stature nor
in countenance does he give evidence of the stern courage and indomitable
will which have raised him to the pinnacle of fame.</p>

<p>When he sat down the mayor proposed three times three banzais,
and they were given with a will by the enormous crowd that stood in
the open place before the stand. While writing this article, I am
in receipt of information that Mayor Ozaki has secured for me one
of the little camp stools above referred to and has had made for me
a duplicate of the other. They will not only be interesting souvenirs
of an historic occasion, and prized as such, but they will be interesting
also because they contrast so sharply with the large and richly upholstered
chairs used in America on similar occasions.</p>

<p>From this public meeting the admiral and his officers were conducted
to a neighboring hall where an elaborate luncheon was served.
With the councilmen I went to this hall and was presented to the
admiral and his associates, one of whom had been a student at
Annapolis.</p>

<p>By the courtesy of Hon. Lloyd Griscom, the American minister, I
had an audience with the emperor, these audiences being arranged
through the minister representing the country from which the caller
comes. Our minister, to whom I am indebted for much assistance
and many kindnesses during my stay at the capital, accompanied me
to the palace and instructed me, as they say in the fraternities, "in the
secret work of the order." Except where the caller wears a uniform,
he is expected to appear in evening dress, although the hour fixed is
in the day time. At the outer door stand men in livery, one of whom
conducts the callers through long halls, beautifully decorated on ceilings
and walls, to a spacious reception room where a halt is made
until the summons comes from the emperor's room. The emperor
stands in the middle of the receiving room with an interpreter at his
side. The caller on reaching the threshold bows; he then advances
half way to the emperor, pauses and bows again; he then proceeds
and bows a third time as he takes the extended hand of the sovereign.</p>

<p>The conversation is brief and formal, consisting of answers to the
questions asked by his majesty. The emperor is fifty-three years old,
about five feet six inches in height, well built and wears a beard,
although, as is the case with most Japanese, the growth is not heavy.
On retiring the caller repeats the three bows.</p>

<p>We were shown through the palace, and having seen the old palace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a><br /><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
at Kyoto, which was the capital until the date of the restoration
(1868), I was struck with the difference. The former was severely
plain; the latter represents the best that Japanese art can produce.</p>

<p>No discussion of Japanese customs would be complete without mention
of the tea ceremonial. One meets tea on his arrival; it is his
constant companion during his stay and it is mingled with the farewells
that speed him on his departure. Whenever he enters a house
he is offered tea and cake and they are never refused. This custom
prevails in the larger stores and is scrupulously observed at public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
buildings and colleges. The tea is served in dainty cups and taken
without sugar or cream. The tea drinking habit is universal here,
the kettle of hot water sitting on the coals in the brazier most of the
time. At each railroad station the boys sing out, "Cha! Cha!" (the
Japanese word for tea) and for less than two cents in our money they
will furnish the traveler with an earthen pot of hot tea, with pot and
cup thrown in.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">COUNT OKUMA.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The use of tea at social gatherings dates back at least six hundred
years, when a tea ceremonial was instituted by a Buddhist priest to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
soften the manners of the warriors. It partook of a religious character
at first, but soon became a social form, and different schools of
tea drinkers vied with each other in suggesting rules and methods
of procedure. About three hundred years ago Hideyoshi, one of the
greatest of the military rulers of Japan, gave what is described as
the largest tea party on record; the invitations being in the form of
an imperial edict. All lovers of tea were summoned to assemble at
a given date in a pine grove near Kyoto, and they seem to have done
so. The tea party lasted ten days and the emperor drank at every
booth.</p>

<p>According to Chamberlain, tea drinking had reached the luxurious
stage before the middle of the fourteenth century. The lords took
part in the daily gatherings, reclining on tiger skins, the walls of
the guest chamber being richly ornamented. One of the popular
games of that day was the offering of a number of varieties of tea,
the guests being required to guess where each variety was produced,
the best guess winning a handsome prize. The tea ceremony answered
at least one useful purpose&mdash;it furnished an innocent way of killing
time, and the lords of that day seem to have had an abundance of
time on their hands. The daughters of the upper classes were trained
to perform the ceremony and displayed much skill therein. Even to
this day it is regarded as one of the accomplishments, and young
ladies perfect themselves in it, much as our daughters learn music and
singing. At Kagoshima, Governor Chikami, one of the most scholarly
men whom I have met here, had his daughter perform for my instruction
a part of the ceremony, time not permitting more. With
charming grace she prepared, poured and served this Japanese nectar,
each motion being according to the rules of the most approved sect,
for there are sects among tea drinkers.</p>

<p>The theatre is an ancient institution here, although until recently
the actors were considered beneath even the mercantile class. Their
social standing has been somewhat improved since the advent of western
ideas. The theatre building is very plain as compared with ours
or even with the better class of homes here. They are always on the
ground floor and have a circular, revolving stage within the larger
stage which makes it possible to change the scenes instantly.</p>

<p>The plays are divided into two kinds&mdash;historical ones reproducing
old Japan, and modern plays. The performance often lasts through
the entire day and evening, some of the audience bringing their tea
kettles and food. Lunches, fruit, cigarettes and tea are also on sale
in the theatre. The people sit on the floor as they do in their homes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
and at public meetings. One of the side aisles is raised to the level
of the stage and the actors use it for entrance and exit.</p>

<p>In this connection a word should be said in regard to the Geisha
girls who have furnished such ample material for the artist and the
decorator. They are selected for their beauty and trained in what is
called a dance, although it differs so much from the American dance
as scarcely to be describable by that term. It is rather a series of
graceful poses in which gay costumes, dainty fans, flags, scarfs and
sometimes parasols, play a part. The faces of the dancers are expressionless
and there is no exposure of the limbs. The Geisha girls
are often called in to entertain guests at a private dinner, the performance
being before, not after, the meal.</p>

<p>Our first introduction to this national amusement was at the Maple
Club dinner given at Tokyo by a society composed of Japanese men
who had studied in the United States. The name of the society is a
Japanese phrase which means the "Friends of America." The Maple
Club is the most famous restaurant in Japan, and the Geisha girls
employed there stand at the head of their profession. During the
dancing there is music on stringed instruments, which resembles the
banjo in tone, and sometimes singing. At the Maple Club the Geisha
girls displayed American and Japanese flags. We saw the dancing
again at an elaborate dinner given by Mr. Fukuzawa, editor of the
Jiji Shimpo. Here also the flags of both nations were used.</p>

<p>In what words can I adequately describe the hospitality of the
Japanese? I have read, and even heard, that among the more ignorant
classes there is a decided anti-foreign feeling, and it is not unnatural
that those who refuse to reconcile themselves to Japan's new attitude
should blame the foreigner for the change, but we did not encounter
this sentiment anywhere. Never in our own country have we been
the recipients of more constant kindness or more considerate attention.
From Marquis Ito down through all the ranks of official life we found
everyone friendly to America, and to us as representatives of America.
At the dinner given by Minister Griscom there were present, besides
Marquis Ito, the leader of the liberal party, Count Okuma, the leader
of the progressive party (the opposition party), and a number of
other prominent Japanese politicians.</p>

<p>At the dinner given by Consul General Miller at Yokohama, Governor
Sufu and Mayor Ichihara were present. The state and city
officials wherever we have been have done everything possible to make
our stay pleasant. The college and school authorities have opened
their institutions to us and many without official position have in unmistakable
ways shown themselves friendly. We will carry away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
with us a number of handsome presents bestowed by municipalities,
colleges, societies and individuals.</p>

<p>We were entertained by Count Okuma soon after our arrival and
met there, among others, Mr. Kato of the state department, and
President Hatoyama of the Waseda University, and their wives. The
count's house is half European and half Japanese, and his garden
is celebrated for its beauty. At Viscount Kana's we saw a delightful
bit of home life. He is one of the few daimios, or feudal lords, who
has become conspicuous in the politics of Japan, and we soon discovered
the secret of his success. He has devoted himself to the interests
of agriculture and spent his time in an earnest and intelligent
effort to improve the condition of the rural population. He is known
as "The Farmer's Friend." His house is at the top of a beautifully
terraced hill, which was once a part of his feudal estate. He and
his wife and six children met us at the bottom of the hill on our
arrival and escorted us to the bottom on our departure. The children
assisted in serving the dinner and afterward sang for us the American
national air as well as their own national hymn. The hospitality
was so genuine and so heartily entered into by all the family that
we could hardly realize that we were in a foreign land and entertained
by hosts to whom we had to speak through an interpreter.</p>

<p>In the country, fifteen miles from Kagoshima, I was a guest at
the home of Mr. Yamashita, the father of the young man, who, when
a student in America, made his home with us for more than five years.
Mr. Yamashita was of the samurai class and since the abolition of
feudalism has been engaged in farming. He had invited his relatives
and also the postmaster and the principal of the district school
to the noon meal. He could not have been more thoughtful of my
comfort or more kindly in his manner. The little country school
which stood near by turned out to bid us welcome. The children
were massed at a bridge over which large flags of the two nations
floated from bamboo poles. Each child also held a flag, the
Japanese and American flags alternating. As young Yamashita and
I rode between the lines they waved their flags and shouted "Banzai."
And so it was at other schools. Older people may be diplomatic and
feign good will, but children speak from their hearts. There is no
mistaking their meaning, and in my memory the echo of the voices
of the children, mingling with the assurances of the men and women,
convinces me that Japan entertains nothing but good will toward our
nation. Steam has narrowed the Pacific and made us neighbors; let
Justice keep us friends.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>JAPAN&mdash;HER HISTORY AND PROGRESS.</h3>


<p>As for the islands themselves, they are largely of volcanic origin,
and a number of smoking peaks still give evidence of the mighty
convulsions which piled up these masses of masonry. Asosan mountain,
on the island of Kyushu, has the largest crater in the world.</p>

<p>Japan is the home of the earthquake. The Japanese Year Book
of 1905 is authority for the statement that Japan was visited by
17,750 earthquakes during the thirteen years ending 1887&mdash;an average
of more than thirteen hundred a year, or three and a half each
day. It is needless to say that a large majority of these were so
trivial as to be unnoticed, except by those in charge of the delicate
instrument which registers them.</p>

<p>If the average is as great at this time, there have been more than
seventy-five since we landed, but we have not been aware of them.
The severe shocks have come at periods averaging two and a half
years, and the really disastrous ones have been something like fifty
years apart. The country about Tokyo is most subject to earthquakes,
the last severe one being in 1894. According to an ancient legend,
Japan rests upon the back of a large fish and the earthquakes are
caused by the moving of the fish. There is a Seismological society in
Japan which has published a sixteen-volume work giving all that is
scientifically known of the cause and recurrence of these disturbances.</p>

<p>Of the origin of the Japanese themselves nothing certain is known.
The best authorities say that they came from the continent in an early
Mongol invasion, while others believe that they came from the islands
which stretch to the south. One writer announces the theory that
they are the lost Israelites. It is quite certain that when the first
Japanese landed on the islands they found an earlier race in possession.
Some seventeen thousand of these, called Ainus, now occupy the
northern extremity of the empire&mdash;an indication that the migration
was from the southwest. The Ainus have remained distinct; where
they have intermarried with the Japanese, the half breeds have died<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a><br /><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
out in the second or third generation. They are a hairy race and in
physical characteristics quite different from the Japanese. Their religion
is a sort of nature worship, and it is their custom to say a
simple grace before eating.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><a name="guest" id="guest"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE GUEST OF GOV. CHIKAMI AT KAGOSHIMA</p></div>
</div>

<p>The remoteness of the settlement of Japan is shown by the fact that
the reigning family, which claims descent from the gods, has held
undisputed sway for twenty-five hundred years, although the record
of the first thousand years is so dependent upon verbal tradition that
the official history cannot be verified. As concubinage has been practiced
from time immemorial, the heir, the oldest son, has not always
been born of the empress.</p>

<p>Soon after the beginning of the Christian era the influence of China
and Korea began to be felt in Japan, the written characters of the
language being quite like the Chinese. Koreans and Japanese do
not agree as to the influence which the former have had upon the latter.
A very intelligent Korean informs me that his is the mother country
and that Japan was settled from Korea, but the Japanese do not take
kindly to this theory.</p>

<p>The feudal system, of which I shall speak more at length in another
article, was early established in Japan, and society was divided
into well defined classes. First came the members of the royal family
and those admitted to the circle by favor; next, the Shogun (of whom
more will be heard under the subject of government) and his relatives.</p>

<p>Next in rank were the daimios, or lords, of varying degrees of
importance. Each daimio had a large number of retainers, who were
called samurai, and below these were a still larger number of peasants
who tilled the soil and did the manual labor. Some of the early
pictures show the gorgeous dress of the daimios and portray the elaborate
ceremony employed on state occasions.</p>

<p>The samurai were the warriors and had no other occupation than
to defend their lords in the struggles between the clans. They corresponded
to the knights in Europe during the days of chivalry, except
that there were no romantic adventures over women&mdash;woman
holding until recently a very subordinate place as compared with
"her lord and master."</p>

<p>The samurai were given an annual allowance for their subsistence,
and felt that toil was far beneath their dignity. They wore lacquered
armor and costly helmets and carried two swords&mdash;a long one for the
enemy and a short one for themselves.</p>

<p>It was with this short sword that the famous hara-kiri was committed.
This ancient form of suicide by disembowelment was considered an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
highly honorable death and has been practiced until within a generation.
General Saigo, one of the great men of Japan and one of
its popular heroes, was the last man of prominence to terminate his
life in this way. He was one of the leaders in the movement to restore
to the emperor the authority which the shoguns had usurped and
was for a while close to the throne. In 1874, however, he organized
an army for the invasion of Korea, and coming into conflict with the
forces of the empire, which were called out to prevent the invasion,
he was defeated. In his humiliation he committed hara-kiri. A few
years ago the title of Marquis was conferred upon him by a posthumous
decree and is now enjoyed by his eldest son. One of his
sons is the present mayor of Kyoto and another a colonel in the Imperial
Guard. A bronze monument of heroic size, the gift of admiring
friends, has recently been placed in the principal park in Tokyo.</p>

<p>Only a few years ago a young Japanese committed suicide in this
way in order to emphasize his protest against the encroachments of
the Russians, but a strong sentiment is developing against hara-kiri,
and it will soon take its place among other obsolete customs.</p>

<p>The samurai represented the intellectual as well as the military
strength of the nation. The daimios have furnished few of the men
of prominence in modern Japan, nearly all of the leaders in government,
education, literature and the professions having come from the
samurai class. Now, however, that all social distinctions have been
removed and the schools opened to the children of all, the old lines
between the classes cannot so easily be traced.</p>

<p>The merchant class has always been looked down upon in Japan.
In the social scale the members of this class were not only lower than
the samurai, but lower than the tillers of the soil. It was probably
because of the contempt in which they were held that so low a standard
of integrity existed among them&mdash;at least this is the explanation
usually given. Even now Japanese, as well as foreigners, complain
that the merchants impose upon their customers, but here also a
change is taking place and a new order of things being inaugurated.
There are in every city merchants of honor and responsibility who
are redeeming trade from the stigma which it so long bore. Still,
unless the stranger knows with whom he is dealing, it is well to have
a Japanese advisor, for we found by experience that the price named
to foreigners was sometimes considerably above the regular price.</p>

<p>For centuries Japan lived an isolated life and developed herself
according to her own ideas. Of her native religion, Shintoism, of
the introduction of Buddhism and of the first Christian missionaries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
I shall speak in a later article. She repelled an attack of the Mongols
which might have been disastrous to her but for the fact that a timely
storm destroyed the invading fleet, much as the Spanish Armada was
destroyed. She has from time to time attempted the invasion of
Korea, the last attempt being made about three hundred years ago.
A little later the Shogun, Iemitsu, alarmed by the spread of the
Christian religion, introduced
by Catholic missionaries
from Spain and
Portugal, shut the country
up, and for two and
a half centuries no foreigner
was admitted and
no citizen of Japan was
permitted to go abroad.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 250px;"><a name="american" id="american"></a>
<img src="images/ill017.jpg" width="250" height="464" alt="american" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">JAPANESE LADY IN AMERICAN DRESS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>To more surely keep
his people at home the
Shogun prohibited the
building of any but small
sailing vessels. It is almost
incredible that so
large a group of people
could have enjoyed the
civilization which existed
here and still concealed
themselves so completely
from the outside world
and remained so ignorant
of the mighty movements
in Europe and America.
In 1853 Commodore Perry
arrived with an American
fleet and a treaty was
finally entered into which
opened the country to
foreign intercourse.
Japan was ripe for the change. While there was at first an anti-foreign
sentiment which affected domestic politics and at one time
resulted in an attack upon a foreign fleet, the assimilation of western
civilization was rapid and constant. Young men began to go abroad,
foreign teachers were sent for and the Japanese people began to manifest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
a wonderful aptitude for the adaptation of foreign ideas to local
conditions. The army and navy were reconstructed upon the European
models and a public school system largely like our own was
established.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 421px;"><a name="maiden" id="maiden"></a>
<img src="images/ill018.jpg" width="421" height="600" alt="maiden" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">A JAPANESE MAIDEN.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In most countries reforms have come up from the masses through
more or less prolonged seasons of agitation, but in Japan the higher
classes have been the leaders and have extended increasing social and
governmental advantages to the whole people without a struggle. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
every department of thought there has been progress, and in every line
of work there have been leaders whose ambitions and ideals have been
high and noble.</p>

<p>To illustrate the change that has taken place, Count Okuma cites
the case of the famous military genius, the present Marshal Yamagata.
When a very young man Yamagata was a spearman in the
army organized by the daimios of Choshu to attack the foreign ships
at the Shimonoseki Straits. He was so ignorant of modern warfare
that he was confident of the ability of the Japanese to defeat the
foreigners with spears. He thought that the Europeans and Americans
would be at the mercy of the natives as soon as they landed.
His surprise may be imagined when leaden missiles mowed down his
comrades long before the spears could be brought into use. But this
young man who attempted in 1864 to measure spear against rifle,
betook himself to the study of the military methods of the foreigners,
and in the recent war with Russia he has been chief of the general
staff of the Japanese army&mdash;an army which in equipment, in preparation,
and in provision for sick and wounded, as well as in its exploits
upon the battlefield, has astonished the world. Count Okuma
said that the progress made in the army and in the navy was paralleled
by the progress made in other directions.</p>

<p>While there are here abundant preparations for war, there is a
prevalent desire for peace. Notwithstanding Japan has a most efficient
army and navy, and notwithstanding the natural exultation over
their success at arms, the Japanese as I have met them are strongly
inclined toward peace. Several times in introducing me the presiding
officer has referred in terms of generous appreciation to the action of
our president in bringing about the recent treaty of peace. The wars
against China and Russia have been regarded by the people as defensive
wars and it will be remembered that the civil war of 1874
was simply a suppression by the government of an attempt to invade
Korea. General Saigo raised his army for the purpose of conquering
Korea, but the government met the insurrectionists with an army
large enough to completely overwhelm the forces of the famous
general.</p>

<p>The Anglo-Japanese alliance is everywhere defended as a guarantee
of peace. I met yesterday a Japanese of some local prominence who
has issued a plea for universal peace. He proposes the establishment
of an international peace society and in earnest language sets forth
the horrors of war and the material, as well as the moral, arguments
in favor of peace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Upon no element of Japanese society has the rising sun of a higher
civilization shed its rays more benignantly than upon woman. The
position of the mother was an honored one when she became the head
of the family, but while the children cared for both parents with a
generous filial devotion, the wife and daughter were under the almost
absolute power of the husband and father. Marriages were arranged
by the parents and the young people were allowed to see each other
after the match was agreed upon. Theoretically, each had a right
to protest if dissatisfied, but practically the girl's protest amounted
to nothing.</p>

<p>The wife was not only the servant of the husband, but might also
be the servant of the mother-in-law&mdash;the mother-in-law joke being
here on the daughter-in-law instead of the son-in-law. The fact that
the husband was permitted to keep as many concubines as he desired
still further lowered the status of woman. The daughters were often
sold into prostitution to relieve the indebtedness of the father, and
while this custom is on the decline, there are still thousands of Japanese
girls whose virtue is made a matter of merchandise in accordance
with this ancient custom. There is recorded among the decisions of
Ooka, sometimes called the Japanese Solomon, who lived three centuries
ago, a case in which the release of a young woman from a
house of ill-fame was the central feature. The report of the judge's
decree shows a discriminating mind as well as devotion to justice.
Incidentally, the record reveals the fact that there were Shylocks in
those days who loaned on short time at high rates and exacted the
pound of flesh. In this case, the usurer compelled the sale of the
daughter in extinguishment of a debt of fifteen yen, which by rapidly
accumulating interest, had reached the, to them, enormous sum of
thirty-five yen (or $17.50). The righteous judge confiscated the
house of the extortioner and with the proceeds redeemed the woman.
By the aid of the missionaries, under the leadership of Rev. Murphy,
of Nagoya, legislation has been secured making it unlawful for a girl
to be retained in one of these houses against her will, and many have
already been rescued. As the taking of a concubine is a matter of
record it is possible for the newspapers to acquaint themselves with the
domestic relations of prominent men, and some of the papers have
assisted in creating a public opinion against concubines. This custom
is certain to give way before the advance of western ideas.</p>

<p>One of the foremost leaders in the elevation of woman was Yukichi
Fukuzawa, one of the greatest, as well as one of the most influential,
of the men who have appeared in Japan. He was a journalist,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
an educator, an orator and a philosopher. He refused to accept any
titles or decorations and was called "The Great Commoner." He
founded a college, the Keio-Gijuku, to which many of the public men
trace their ideals and their interest in national and social problems.
He delivered the first public speech made in Japan for, strange as it
may seem, the habit of public speaking does not reach farther back
than twenty-three years.
Until constitutional government
was formed there
was no place for the
forum. Shortly before his
death, Mr. Fukuzawa reduced
his philosophy to
the form of a code of
morals which has made
a profound impression upon
the thought of his
country. He presented "independence
and self respect,"
as he defined them,
as the "cardinal tenet of
personal morals and living."
He insisted upon
the care of the body, the
training of the mind and
the cultivation of the
moral nature. He was one
of the first to raise his
voice against hara-kiri and in his code of morals he says: "To complete
the natural span of life is to discharge a duty incumbent on
man. Therefore, any person who, be the cause what it may or the
circumstances what they may, deprives himself by violence of his
own life, must be said to be guilty of an act inexcusable and cowardly,
as well as mean, and entirely opposed to the principle of independence
and self respect."</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 300px;"><a name="jr" id="jr"></a>
<img src="images/ill019.jpg" width="300" height="340" alt="jr" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">MR. YUKICHI FUKAZAWA, JR.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Concerning woman his code of morals says: "The custom of regarding
women as the inferiors of men is a vicious relic of barbarism.
Men and women of any enlightened country must treat and love each
other on a basis of equality, so that each may develop his or her own
independence and self respect."</p>

<p>When this great man died in 1901 his widow was in receipt of letters
from many women expressing their appreciation of his labors in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
behalf of the women of Japan. Some of these are reproduced in a
life of Mr. Fukuzawa, recently issued, and show the deep gratitude
which the women feel toward him. It is also interesting to know that
Mr. Fukuzawa believed in the dignity of labor and taught that each
person should be "an independent worker beside being his own breadwinner."
While he taught patriotism, he also taught that the people
of all nations "are brethren" and that "no discrimination should be
made in dealing with them."</p>

<p>The emperor sent him, just before his death, fifty thousand yen
as a recognition of his eminent services, but he immediately turned
the sum over to the Keio-Gijuku.</p>

<p>The Jiji Shimpo, the newspaper established by Mr. Fukuzawa, is still
conducted by one of his sons, with whom we had the pleasure of dining.
Another son is an instructor in the Keio-Gijuku.</p>

<p>Newspaper development has kept pace with the development in
other directions. Tokyo, the capital, has sixteen daily papers with
sufficient circulation to make them known as large papers. Besides
these, there are magazines, periodicals and papers published in English.
The Kokumin Shimbun is known as the government organ while most
of the others are regarded as independent. The Tokyo Times is an excellent
paper published in English. There is a weekly publication
called the Economist, with a circulation of five thousand, which deals
with commercial, financial and economic questions. Yokohama has
papers published in both languages and the same is true of the other
large seaport towns.</p>

<p>All the cities are supplied with daily papers published in Japanese.
At Kagoshima, a city of about fifty thousand, situated at the southern
extremity of Kyushu Island, I found a prosperous daily paper called
the Kagoshima Shimbun. (Shimbun means daily newspaper.) It
has a circulation of nine thousand six hundred, six thousand being in
the city.</p>

<p>At Osaka I noticed a building elaborately decorated. In front were
large flags on bamboo poles and smaller flags strung on cords, while
Japanese lanterns were present in profusion. As none of the buildings
around were decorated, I inquired and found that the decorated
building was the office of the Osaka Asahi News and that the paper
was celebrating the withdrawal of the governmental order which for
two weeks had suspended its publication. The issue for that day contained
a large sized picture of the Goddess of Liberty. When rioting
occurred at Tokyo just after the treaty of peace with Russia, an order
was issued authorizing the arbitrary suspension of any newspaper containing
utterances deemed incendiary. Under this order the Asahi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
News received notice to suspend publication until permission was
granted to resume. The withdrawal of the notice was duly celebrated
and the paper announced that its readers, rather than the paper,
had reason to complain of the suspension. This paper has the largest
circulation of any in Japan, about two hundred thousand, and the
order suspending it has been the subject of much editorial criticism.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="sumitka" id="sumitka"></a>
<img src="images/ill020.jpg" width="400" height="420" alt="sumitka" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">SUMITKA HASEBA&mdash;JAPANESE STATESMAN.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Besides the newspapers which are conducted as business propositions,
there are papers supported by associations formed for the propagation
of various reforms. For instance, a paper called Romaji is published
monthly at Tokyo&mdash;Japanese words being spelled with Roman letters,
in the place of the present Japanese characters. A society was formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
some twenty years ago for the purpose of urging this reform and a
paper advocating it was published for three years, but finally suspended
from lack of support. This fall the Romaji was established and hopes
for a better fate. While this reform would be very acceptable to
foreigners who are trying to learn the language, the movement does
not seem to have gathered much momentum.</p>

<p>In one of the leading papers, the Hocho Shimbun, Mr. Gensai Murai,
a novelist of distinction, published a continued story running daily
through six years. It is not yet completed, having been suspended
during the war. In this story the writer presents a large amount of
information on national, political, economic and social questions, at
the same time putting in enough fiction to sustain the interest.</p>

<p>Progress along some other lines will be treated under special heads.
I find that there is some tendency here to resent the statement that
Japan has borrowed largely from other nations. Some native writers
insist that New Japan is but the natural development of Old Japan.
There is a measure of truth in this, because there is no growth except
from a living germ; and yet it can not be denied that Japan has appropriated
to her own great advantage many foreign ideas, and it is not
to her discredit that she has done so. Both individuals and nations
borrow; imitation, not originality, is the rule. It will humble the pride
of anyone to attempt to separate that which he has learned from others
from that which he can claim as his own by right of discovery.</p>

<p>Steam is the same to-day that it was ages ago, and yet millions
watched it escaping from the kettle with no thought of its latent power.
One man showed mankind the use to which it could be put and all
the rest profited by the idea. Shall we refuse to ride upon the railroad
or cross the waters in an ocean greyhound for fear of employing the
conception of another? Electricity is not a new agency. The lightnings
have illumined the sky from the dawn of creation, and the
people saw in them only cause for fear. A few decades ago one man
thought out a method by which it could be imprisoned in a wire, and
now widely separated lands are united by telegraph lines, while cables
traverse the ocean's bed. Shall we refuse to read the news that the
current carries or reject a message from home because we must employ
an idea which sprang from another's brain? He is stupid who rejects
truth, no matter from what source it comes; that nation is
blind which does not welcome light from anywhere and everywhere.
It is to the glory, not to the shame, of the land of the Rising Sun that
her people have been quick to obey the injunction, "Prove all things;
hold fast that which is good."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>INDUSTRIES, ARTS AND COMMERCE.</h3>


<p>The basis of Japanese industry is agricultural, although each year
shows a decreasing proportion engaged in the tilling of the soil. Rice
is the principal product, but owing to the large amount consumed at
home it is not the chief export. As this crop needs an abundance of
water, the rice fields occupy the low lands and the mountain gorges.
Sometimes the narrow valleys that pierce the ranges are so terraced
as to look like steps, and at this time of the year when the crop is being
harvested, they resemble golden stairs. The men and women work together
in the field, and in many places we saw them standing almost
knee deep in mud, cutting the grain with old fashioned hand-sickles.
The rice is tied in bundles somewhat smaller than our wheat sheaves,
and hung over poles or laid along the edge of a terrace to cure. If the
threshing is delayed the grain is stacked, not as we stack wheat and
oats in the United States, but in little columns with the heads of the
sheaves tied to a pole in the center. Sometimes the stacks are built
around a living tree. The grain is separated from the straw by means
of a long toothed comb, and at this season innumerable groups of persons
are busily engaged at this work. The yellow heaps of rice in the
hull, looking from a distance like wheat, can be seen from the train
and from the country roads. Straw mats are used to keep the grain
off the ground and, I may add, the mat is in evidence everywhere
in Japan and is used for all sorts of purposes.</p>

<p>The cultivation of the tea plant is an industry of no small magnitude,
although not so universal as the cultivation of rice. The tea
fields occupy the higher levels and add an interesting variety to the
landscapes. At one point on the railroad between Yokohama and
Nagoya the hillsides are covered with tea plantations, if such tiny farms
can be called plantations. The tea plant is something like our gooseberry
and currant bushes in size, but the foliage is much thicker. The
leaves vary widely in value, from the cheaper grades, which are exported,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
to the Uji which costs what is equivalent to five or more dollars
per pound.</p>

<p>Some cotton is grown here, but the cotton plant as we saw it is
small compared with our plant, and the tillable area is too limited to
admit of the growing of cotton on a large scale.</p>

<p>Tobacco is cultivated to some extent, but the sale of manufactured
tobacco is a government prerogative.</p>

<p>Raw silk is by far the most valuable export, thirty-five million dollars'
worth having been sent abroad last year. Three-fifths of the entire
export goes to the United States, the remainder to Europe, with France
as the largest European purchaser. As fifteen million dollars' worth
of silk fabrics went abroad also, as against five million dollars' worth
of tea and four million dollars' worth of rice, it will be seen that the
cultivation of the silk worm and the mulberry tree is extensively
carried on. The silk worms are kept indoors and the leaves brought
in to them. When put outdoors the silk worms are devoured by birds.</p>

<p>Fruits grow here in great variety. We have found everywhere apples
of excellent quality, raised in the northern parts of the islands, while
the southern islands produce oranges, bananas and pineapples. The
apple tree was imported from America about thirty-five years ago; now
apples are exported to China and Siberia. The most popular orange is
the tangerine, or kid glove orange as it is sometimes called; many of
these are exported.</p>

<p>There is a kind of fruit called the ban-tan grown on the island of
Kyushu. It looks something like the grape fruit, but grows considerably
larger and has a thicker skin; the meat is pink in color, sweeter
and less juicy than the grape fruit. Pears grow here; one variety looks
like a russet apple in shape and color. Peach trees are sometimes
trained as we train grape vines on an arbor, so that the orchard seems
to have a flat roof of foliage.</p>

<p>They have here, too, persimmons as large as apples and as solid. We
found these on the table in all parts of the island and there are several
varieties. The grape is cultivated in Japan, but we did not see grape
vines in such profusion as they are seen in southern Europe, along the
lakes in western New York or in California. And, in this connection,
I may add that wine is not used here to the extent that it is in some
other countries, the national drink, sake, being made from fermented
rice. Ordinarily this beverage contains from eleven to fourteen per
cent of alcohol, but there is a stronger kind called shochu, which contains
as much as fifty per cent of alcohol. It is evident, however, that
liquor by any other name can be as intoxicating as our whisky, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
we found at Tokyo a national temperance society with branches throughout
the empire. Mr. Ando, the president of this society, is a Japanese
gentleman of great earnestness and intelligence, who was converted to
Christianity a few years ago when he was representing his country in
Honolulu. While, as I have stated in another article, I have seen no
evidences of drunkenness, Mr. Ando informs me that his society has
ample work to do. I carry back with me a badge which the society
gave me on learning of my total abstinence habits. I have only mentioned
the leading products of the field, but I can not leave the cultivators
of the soil without a word concerning the gardens. They are
so cute, occupying as they do the little nooks and corners that can not
be utilized for the large crops. There does not seem to be a square
inch of ground wasted. The vegetables are planted in rows which are
either straight or curved, never crooked, and we have scarcely seen a
weed. Fertilizer is extensively used, being kept in stone or cement vats
protected from the weather by a straw colored shed. Near the cities
the soil is enriched by the refuse from closets which is collected and
carried away during the night. The introduction of sewage systems
has been somewhat impeded in some cities by the fact that sewage
would be an expense while closets are now a source of profit. It must
be confessed, however, that the present system tends to make fresh
vegetables unpopular with the tourist.</p>

<p>Most travelers land at Yokohama and depart at Kobe, or land at
Kobe and depart at Yokohama, these being the two principal ports.
As these are about 300 miles apart, one has a chance to see much of
the farming land from the railroad. The side trips from Tokyo to
Nikko, from Yokohama to Miyanoshita and from Kyoto to Nara, give
additional opportunities for seeing the farmer at work, but the ride
from Kobe west to Shimonoseki surpasses any of these in interest and
in beauty of scenery. As this route leads along the sea coast as well
as through densely populated valleys, there is greater variety. Now
one skirts the inland sea, with its numerous islands, its transparent
waters, its little harbors and its fleets of fishing boats; now he winds his
way along a stream with falls and rapids and spanned by frail foot
bridges or by stone wagon bridges. On the one side he sees a bamboo
grove and on the other a tiny graveyard or a little hill dedicated to a
Shinto shrine&mdash;stone steps ascending along a shaded path from the
sacred gate, which invariably marks the entrance to holy ground. In
passing over this railroad route one gathers a large amount of information
concerning the industries of the sea coast, as well as those of the
inland, and besides one can visit the Shimonoseki Strait which is of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
historic interest to Americans. The Sanyo railroad, which connects Kobe
and Shimonoseki, is well equipped and well managed and has built
an excellent hotel, The Sanyo, at Shimonoseki for the accommodation
of its patrons. From this point a steamer runs to Fusan, the nearest
Korean port, where direct connection is made for Seoul, the Korean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
capital. From Moji, just across the strait from Shimonoseki, one
can take a train to Nagasaki, the western seaport of Japan. At
Shimonoseki one is shown the house in which Marquis Ito and Li
Hung Chang drafted the Japanese-Chinese treaty in 1894.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">JAPANESE WATER CARRIER.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Mining is an industry of considerable importance here. Gold,
silver and copper are found in paying quantities. More than six
million dollars' worth of copper was exported last year. One of the
gold fields on the island of Kyushu, near Kagoshima, gives promise
of considerable richness. Coal is found in such abundance that the
exports of this commodity have amounted to nearly ten million dollars
in a single year. A hard quality of smokeless coal has recently
been discovered in western Japan.</p>

<p>The islands also produce a number of varieties of valuable woods.
The camphor tree grows to an enormous size, a gigantic statue of
the Goddess of Mercy in one of the temples at Kamakura being
carved from a single camphor log. The value of the camphor exported
from Japan last year exceeded a million and a half dollars.
Among the hard woods suitable for carving, cherry seems to be the
most popular.</p>

<p>Of all the trees, however, the bamboo is the most useful. Just at
this time when the returning soldiers are being welcomed, it is present
everywhere in the form of flag poles, and there is nothing that equals
it for this purpose; long, slender, light and strong, it is just the thing
for flags and banners, and when a little plume of leaves is left at
the top, it is still more beautiful. The bamboo is used for water
pipes and for fences, for furniture and picture tubes, for dippers,
baskets, fishing poles, flower vases, candlesticks, wicker work, etc., etc.</p>

<p>In wood carving the Japanese have long been skilled. Specimens
of work done hundreds of years ago and testifying to their taste, no
less than to their deftness of hand, may be seen in their ancient palaces
and temples.</p>

<p>Stone cutting is also an ancient industry here. There is an
abundance of stone and granite, while the lanterns, Korean lions and
sacred gates have furnished subjects for many a chisel. Osaka seems
to be the center of the stone cutting industry.</p>

<p>The iron industry is represented by an increasing number of establishments.
In many instances workmen have been brought from
abroad and employed until Japanese artisans were sufficiently trained
to take their place. Much of the iron work is still done in little
shops and by hand, although machinery is being imported in large
quantities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>I visited a tannery at Kagoshima and found that the proprietor
had spent seven years in America learning the business, and that
on his return he had taught native help each branch of the business.
He is now turning out an excellent product.</p>

<p>One of the most promising industries in Japan is cotton spinning.
There are a number of factories already in operation and new ones
are building. I visited one of the plants of the Osaka Nippon Boseki
Kaisha at Osaka. This company has about seventy thousand spindles
and the mills employ nothing but native labor. Foreign artisans
were used in the beginning, but are no longer needed. A great many
women are employed and some children; for the latter a school is
maintained for two hours a day in the building. Cotton yarn is
now selling for about forty cents a pound and is becoming one of
the leading articles of export; China is the largest purchaser. Some
idea of the growth of this branch of industry can be gathered from
the fact that the exports of cotton yarn amounted to less than four
thousand dollars in 1891 and 1892; in 1896 it had grown to over
two millions, in 1898 to over ten millions, and during the last two
years it has averaged about fifteen millions.</p>

<p>At Osaka I also visited a brush industry and found that from
bones, imported from the slaughter houses of America, and from
bristles, purchased in Russia and in China, they made tooth, nail and
hair brushes for export to both Europe and America. Here, too, they
have dispensed with the foreign labor which they employed in the
beginning.</p>

<p>Earthenware is manufactured in abundance and of every variety.
The exports of porcelain and earthenware reached almost two million
dollars last year. In Kyoto we visited a pottery and found two rooms
in which the finished product was displayed; the first contained beautiful
specimens of Japanese skill, graceful in shape and dainty in decoration;
the second was filled with big pieces in loud colors and of inferior
workmanship. These last articles, we were informed, were made
especially for the American trade.</p>

<p>Some beautiful porcelain work is done in Kyoto, the decoration representing
a high degree of artistic skill.</p>

<p>One of the most famous kinds of china produced by Japan is known
as Satsuma ware, the glazing of which is of a peculiar tint and has a
crackled appearance. The secret of the manufacture of this ware was
brought from Korea by the captives taken in war some three hundred
years ago, and the industry still flourishes in Japan, although it has
perished in Korea. Kagoshima is the center for Satsuma ware, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
colony of Koreans living near there, as well as Japanese manufacturers,
produce excellent specimens.</p>

<p>Lacquer work has been done in Japan from time immemorial, samples
of which, centuries old, can be seen in temples, palaces and museums.
When gold and silver are used in connection with the lacquer
the product is often very valuable.</p>

<p>The bronzes produced in the little shops scattered over Japan give
play to the artistic taste which one finds here. Osaka and Kyoto are
noted for their bronzes. Sometimes various metals are inlaid in the
forms of flowers, birds, animals and landscapes, producing a most pleasing
effect. Then there are damascene factories and places for embroidery
and for pictures made in cut velvet, etc., etc.</p>

<p>No one can pass through Japan without being impressed with the
taste, which seems to be national, and with the delicate skill which has
been handed down from generation to generation. And nothing, in
my judgment, more clearly exhibits this union of taste and skill than
the Cloisonne work. Upon a metallic base, as a vase, placque or box, an
artist draws a design; this design is then outlined with fine wires of
gold and silver, then enamels of various colors are filled in. When the
enamels are hardened and the whole polished, the product is a thing
of marvelous beauty.</p>

<p>I have not space to speak of the minor industries, such as paper
making, matches (in which Japan monopolizes the trade of the East),
fans, umbrellas, lanterns, napkins, etc. The Japanese lantern which we
use for ornamentation is here a practical thing, in daily, or rather
nightly, use. These lanterns hang in front of the houses and are carried
on the streets. They are also used for illumination on festive occasions;
at the time of the naval review and the reception to Admiral Togo,
Yokohama and Tokyo were illuminated by these lanterns as I never saw
an American city lighted.</p>

<p>When Japan was opened to the commerce of the world, there were few
business houses or trading establishments of any size. Now there are
several department stores and large wholesale houses, besides manufacturing
and trading companies of importance. One business man in
Tokyo, Mr. K. Okura, has a private collection of curios valued at one
million dollars, which he offered to sell in Europe or America, the proceeds
to be given to the government for carrying on the war against
Russia. Osaka has a successful business man who has earned the name
of the "Japanese Carnegie" by giving a fine library building to that
city.</p>

<p>Consul General Miller, at Yokohama, and Consul Sharp, at Kobe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
furnished me with interesting statistics regarding the commerce of
Japan. Exports have increased from about eighty millions in 1891 to
about three hundred and twenty millions in 1904; during the same
period imports increased from a little more than sixty-three millions
to a little more than three hundred and seventy-one millions. While
our country sells less to Japan than Great Britain and British India,
she buys more than any other nation from Japan. Our chief exports
to Japan last year were electric motors, locomotive engines, steam
boilers and engines, iron pipes, nails, lead, oil, paraffine wax, cotton
drills, cotton duck, raw cotton, tobacco, coal, cars, turning lathes,
condensed milk, flour and wheat. Of these items, flour, raw cotton
and oil were by far the most valuable, each amounting to more than
four and a half million dollars.</p>

<p>In the ocean carrying trade, Japan is making rapid strides. In
ten years her registered steamers have increased from four hundred
and sixty-one to twelve hundred and twenty-four and her sailing vessels
from one hundred and ninety-six to three thousand five hundred
and twenty-three. There are now two hundred private ship yards in
Japan, and in 1903 they built two hundred and seventy-nine vessels.
The Japan Mail Steamship Company has a paid-up capital of
eleven million dollars, runs steamers between Japan, America, Europe
and Asia and pays a ten per cent dividend on its capital. The Osaka
Mercantile Steamship Company (Osaka Shosen Kaisha) has a paid-up
capital of nearly three and a half million dollars, owns about one hundred
vessels and pays a dividend of ten per cent. These are the largest
companies, but there are many smaller ones, some paying dividends
of sixteen and twenty per cent.</p>

<p>I will close this article with the suggestion that the mercantile
marine seems likely to show large growth in the future, offering,
as it does, a legitimate field for national expansion.</p>

<p>Japan's fishing industries furnish a training for seamen and her
people seem at home upon the water. She needs more territory for
her expanding population and has about reached the limit in the
cultivation of her tillable land. Every additional ship manned by her
citizens is like a new island, rising from the waves, upon which her
increasing population can be supported. If she seeks to acquire land
in any direction, she finds her efforts contested by the inhabitants
already there; no wonder she hails with delight these floating farms
constructed by the genius of her own people&mdash;new land, as it were,
won and held without the sacrifice of war.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM AND RELIGIONS.</h3>


<p>Back of Japan's astonishing progress along material lines lies her
amazing educational development. Fifty years ago but few of her
people could read or write; now considerably less than ten per cent
would be classed as illiterate. It is difficult to conceive of such a
transformation taking place almost within a generation. The
prompt adoption of western methods and the rapid assimilation of
western ideas give indubitable proof of the pre-existence of a vital
national germ. A pebble dropped into soil, however rich, and cultivated,
no matter how carefully, gives back no response to the rays
of the springtime sun. Only the seed which has life within can
be awakened and developed by light and warmth and care. Japan
had within her the vital spark, and when the winter of her isolation
was passed, her latent energies burst forth into strong and
sturdy growth.</p>

<p>Her sons, ambitious to know the world, scattered themselves
throughout Europe and America, and having laden themselves with
new ideas, returned to apply them at home. In this way Japan
constantly gained from every quarter and her educational system
is modeled after the best that the ages have produced. She has her
primary schools for boys and girls, attendance being compulsory,
and below these in many places there are kindergarten schools. The
middle schools, in which the boys and girls are separated, take up
the course of instruction where the primary schools leave off.</p>

<p>Then follow the universities, of which there are seven under the
control of the government. Besides these there are in the cities
institutions known as higher commercial schools, which combine general
instruction with such special studies as are taught in our commercial
colleges. There are also a number of normal schools for
the training of teachers. In addition to the schools and colleges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a><br /><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
established and conducted by the government, there are a number
founded by individuals and societies. The largest of these is Waseda
College, founded and still maintained by Count Okuma, the leader of
the progressive party. It is adjoining the home of the count and is
built upon land which he donated. Dr. Hatoyama, at one time
speaker of the national house of representatives, who holds a degree
from Yale College, is the official head of this institution; in all of
its departments it has some five thousand students.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><a name="visit" id="visit"></a>
<img src="images/ill022.jpg" width="600" height="348" alt="visit" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">A VISIT TO COUNT OKUMA'S SCHOOL NEAR TOKYO</p></div>
</div>

<p>I have referred in a former article to the Keio Gijuku, the college
founded by Mr. Fukuzawa. The attendance here is not so large as
at Waseda, but the institution has had an illustrious career and exerts
a wide influence upon the country. I visited both of these colleges
and never addressed more attentive or responsive audiences.
As English is taught in all the middle schools, colleges and universities,
the students are able to follow a speech in that language without
an interpreter.</p>

<p>The state university at Tokyo includes six departments&mdash;law,
medicine and engineering courses being provided, as well as courses
in literature, science and agriculture. The total number of students
enrolled at this university is about thirty-five hundred. The national
university at Kyoto has three faculties&mdash;law, medicine and science&mdash;the
last named including engineering; the attendance at this university
is between six and seven hundred. In the states of Choshu and
Satsuma there are higher schools supported by funds given by former
feudal lords of those states.</p>

<p>The education of girls is not neglected, although as a rule the
girls do not go as far in their studies as the boys. There are a number
of normal schools and seventy-nine high schools for girls, besides
the Peeresses' school and several private institutions. The Woman's
University of Tokyo, situated near Waseda College and under the
patronage of Count Okuma, has had a phenomenal career. Established
only five years ago, it has now an enrollment of some seven
hundred, and is putting up several new buildings.</p>

<p>There are also a number of missionary schools and colleges.
The Presbyterians support three boarding schools for boys and eleven
for girls, besides ten day schools; the total attendance at these schools
is nearly twenty-three hundred.</p>

<p>The Congregationalists have a number of schools, the largest, Doshisha
College at Kyoto, being the most influential Christian institution
in Japan. I had the pleasure of visiting both this college and
Kyoto University.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>The Methodists have eighteen boarding schools and nineteen day
schools with a total attendance of nearly five thousand. Their college
at Kobe is a very promising institution.</p>

<p>The Baptists have a theological seminary, an academy, five boarding
schools for girls and eight day schools, with a total attendance of
nearly a thousand. The Episcopal Church has also taken an important
part in educational work, while the Catholics (who were first
on the ground) have over sixty seminaries, schools and orphanages,
with an attendance of some six thousand.</p>

<p>The Japanese government supports more than twenty-five thousand
primary schools, attended by over five million boys and girls;
it supports more than two hundred and fifty middle schools, with an
attendance of nearly one hundred thousand. While less than two
per cent of the primary students enter the middle schools, more than
ten per cent of the middle school students enter the higher colleges.</p>

<p>Although these figures give some idea of the interest taken in education,
they do not furnish an adequate conception of the enthusiasm
with which a large number of these students pursue their studies.
Nearly fifty young men called upon me or wrote to me asking to be
taken to America that they might continue their studies. Many of
the leading men in Japan to-day are graduates of American or
European colleges. The physicians have shown a preference for
German schools, while to engineers and politicians our universities
have been more attractive. A part of the friendliness felt toward
foreigners can be traced to the favors shown Japanese boys who left
home in search of knowledge. Marquis Ito, one of the first of these,
owes much to an elder of the Presbyterian Church in England in
whose home he lived as a student, and the marquis has ever since
been making returns in kindness to foreigners and Christians.</p>

<p>Marquis Ito's case is not exceptional; all over Japan are men who
hold in grateful remembrance Americans and Europeans to whom
they are indebted for assistance. I met a man, now the publisher of
an influential paper, who twenty years ago, at the age of sixteen,
went to sea and in a shipwreck was cast upon one of the islands in
the South Pacific. He became a retainer for the king of the islands
and as such wore the scanty native dress, consisting of a loin cloth.
He went with his king to Honolulu to pay a visit to the Hawaiian
queen, and finding a Japanese settlement there, remained for two or
three years. He then went to the United States and, making a friend
of a professor in one of the universities, attended school there for
several years. He now visits the United States every year or so on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
business, and one seeing him wearing a silk hat and a Prince Albert
coat would hardly guess the experiences through which he has risen
to his present position. If Japan, beginning fifty years ago with no
educational system and scarcely any educated men or women, could
accomplish what she has accomplished in half a century, what will
she accomplish in the twentieth century, with the start which she now
has and with the educational advantages which her people now enjoy?</p>

<p>Japan has several religions, although Shintoism has been, since
1868, the state religion. As a matter of fact, however, Shintoism
can hardly be called a religion for it has no creed, no priesthood and
no code of morals. It is really ancestor worship and comes down
from time immemorial. It implies a belief in immortality, for the
ancestral spirits are invoked and vows are paid to them at the numberless
shrines that dot the country. These shrines are not usually
in temples, although sometimes Shintoism and Buddhism have been
mixed together and one temple employed for both shrines; as a rule,
however, the Shinto shrine is in some secluded spot on the top of a hill
or on a mountain side where a bit of natural scenery awakens a spirit
of reverence. A gate of simple but beautiful design is placed at the
point where the pathway to the shrine departs from the main road.
We had read of these Shinto gates and had seen pictures of them,
but we first saw one at Honolulu, itself the gateway to the Orient.
No description can convey to the reader the impression which this
gate makes upon the traveler; its outlines are so graceful and yet so
strong that it seems an appropriate portal to a holy place.</p>

<p>The moral code of Confucius has also influenced the thought of
Japan.</p>

<p>About fourteen hundred years ago the Buddhist religion was introduced
into Japan by Chinese priests, and it spread rapidly throughout
the islands. Its temples were imposing, its ceremonies impressive
and the garb of its priests costly and elaborate. It did not root out
Shintoism, it simply overwhelmed and absorbed it. The Buddhist
temples, though not as popular as they once were, are still visited by
millions of believers and are objects of interest to the tourist. Most
of them are old, one at Nara having been built about the year 700.
It is in such an excellent state of preservation that one can hardly
believe that it has stood the storms of twelve centuries.</p>

<p>In the center of the temple is an image of Buddha, and on either
side the figure of a huge warrior. There is also in this temple a God
of War to which the Japanese were wont to pay their vows before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
going to battle. The devout Buddhist, approaching the image of the
founder of his religion, bows and mutters a prayer, half audibly,
and, throwing his mite in a box or on the floor before the shrine,
departs. There is usually a bell, or sometimes only a chain, hanging
above the place where prayers are said, and the suppliant swings
a rope against the bell or shakes
the chain before his prayer and
claps his hands two or three times
at its close. We inquired about the
bell and received two answers: One,
that it was to attract the attention
of the god, and the other that it
was to awaken the conscience of
the one about to present his petition.</p>

<p>Near the temple at Nara stands
an ugly image which never fails to
attract the attention of the visitor.
It is literally covered with paper
wads which have been thrown
against it by worshipers at the temple
in the belief that their prayers
would be answered if the wads
adhered to the image. There is also
at Nara a huge bell, almost as old
as the temple. This bell is about
thirteen feet high, nine feet in diameter
and eight inches thick. It
hangs in a pagoda quite near the
ground, and when struck upon the
side by a swinging log gives forth
a sound of wonderful depth and
richness. It was rung for us, and
as its mellow tones reverberated
along the hills we were awed by the
thought that a thousand years before
our Declaration of Independence
was written, eight hundred years before the Pilgrims landed at
Plymouth Rock, yes, even seven hundred years before America was
discovered, this old bell was calling people to worship.</p>

<p>There is at Nara an immense bronze image of Buddha, even larger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
than the famous one at Kamokura,
though not so finely
proportioned. The smaller
one is forty-nine feet in
height and nearly one hundred
feet in circumference
(both represent Buddha,
seated tailor-fashion, on a
lotus flower) and the larger
one is almost twice as large
as the smaller one. The lantern
of stone or bronze seems
to be as necessary an adjunct
to a Buddhist temple as the
Shinto gate is to that form
of religion. At Nara there
are twenty-nine hundred
stone lanterns of various
sizes along the walks that lead from one temple to another, and they are
found in abundance in other cities. The Korean lions are also identified
with Buddhistic worship, these animals wrought in bronze or carved
in stone guarding all temple doors. They are not as ferocious in appearance
as the Numidian
lion, and they illustrate an
idea. One has his mouth
open and the other has his
mouth tightly shut, and
they together represent the
affirmative and the negative,
or, in other words, the
eternal conflict between the
positive and the negative&mdash;one
says yes, the other no.</p>

<p>Nara has an additional
attraction in the form of a
beautiful park containing
some seven hundred deer,
which are here regarded as
sacred animals. They are
so gentle that they will
come, old and young, and
eat from the hand.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>Next to Nara, in our opinion, and in the opinion of many even before
Nara, comes Nikko in beauty and interest. The spot was wisely chosen
for a temple, a foaming stream, rugged mountains and stately trees
adding to the attractiveness of the place. There is a shaded avenue
twenty-five miles long leading from the lowlands to the temple, and it
is said that when other feudal lords were bringing stone lanterns, one
poor daimio, unable to make so large a gift, offered to plant little trees
along the way; these, now three hundred years old, furnish a grateful
shade for the pilgrims who visit this Mecca, and the poor tree planter is
now known as "The Wise Daimio who went into partnership with
Nature."</p>

<p>The temple at Nikko is only about three centuries old and its decorations
are the richest and most costly to be found in Japan. As the
Buddhists and Shintoists worship together here, the temple is kept in
repair by the government and one can see the best in architecture and
ornamentation that the temples exhibit. So famous are this temple and
its environment that the Japanese have a phrase which when translated
means, "You cannot say beautiful (kekko) until you have seen
Nikko."</p>

<p>The most modern of the large temples is that at Kyoto. It was erected
about thirty years ago on the site of one which had burned. It is not
so large as the original, but is a reproduction in other respects and is one
of the thirty-three temples to which pilgrimages are made. Some estimate
can be formed of the ardor of those who worship here when it is
known that the immense timbers used in the construction of the building
were dragged through the streets and lifted into place by cables
made of human hair contributed by Japanese women for that purpose.
One of these cables, nearly three inches in diameter and several hundred
feet long, is still kept in a room adjacent to the temple, the others
having been destroyed by fire. Japanese women pride themselves upon
their hair and arrange it with great care. What a poem of piety&mdash;what
a strong sacrifice in these myriad strands of mingled black and grey!</p>

<p>All of the Buddhist temples stand within a walled enclosure, entered
through a gorgeous gate which contrasts sharply with the simplicity of
the Shinto gate. The Buddhist gate has a roof resembling a temple
roof and is often ornamented with animals, birds and fantastic figures
carved in wood. As an illustration of the superstition to be found
among the ignorant, the following incident is given: An American,
Mr. Frederick W. Horne, who lives at Yokohama and who has built up
a large importing business in American machinery, has a handsome
new home modeled after a Buddhist temple. At one gable he put a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
devil's head. The servants of the man living next door threatened to
leave because the devil looked over into that yard. But they were
quieted when the neighbor put two brass cannon on his roof and pointed
them at the devil's head. The story seems too absurd to believe, but
we were shown the cannons when we called at Mr. Horne's.</p>

<p>But Buddhism is losing its hold upon the Japanese; its temples are
not crowded as they once were; its ceremonies do not interest and its
teachings do not satisfy the new generation. Christianity will appeal
more and more to the educated element of the Japanese population.
Already favor is taking the place of toleration, as toleration thirty years
ago supplanted persecution.</p>

<p>The Catholics, who have been the pioneers of the Cross in so many
lands, brought Christianity to Japan through their missionaries about
the middle of the sixteenth century. The success of the Jesuits was
so pronounced that in thirty years they estimated their converts at
one hundred and fifty thousand. In fact, the adherents to Christianity
became so numerous and so influential that the Shogun, Hideyoshi,
began to fear for his temporal power, and, having absolute
authority, he expelled the foreigners, closed the ports and established
the policy of non-intercourse with other nations&mdash;a policy which was
followed until 1853. When the country was again opened to Christian
missionaries it was found that some ten thousand men and women
were still worshiping according to the forms of the Catholic Church,
although for two and a half centuries there had been no communication
between them and the church outside. Even after the opening of
the country to foreign commerce there was some persecution of Christians
and several thousand were imprisoned. But in 1873 the prisoners
were set at liberty and the exiles allowed to return; since that time
there has been absolute religious freedom and many men prominent
in official life have been devoted Christians. The most noted of these
native Christians was Mr. Kataoka, who was four times chosen speaker
of the popular branch of the Japanese congress, or diet. He was an
elder in the Presbyterian Church, and when it was suggested that it
would advance his political chances to resign his eldership, he replied
that if compelled to choose between them he would rather be an elder
than speaker.</p>

<p>The Catholic population of Japan numbered fifty-eight thousand
in 1903; at the last report the Protestant communicants numbered
nearly fifty-one thousand. There are among the natives four
hundred and forty-two ordained ministers, five hundred and fifty-nine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
unordained ministers and helpers, and one hundred and eighty-six
theological students. I met a number of Japanese Christians and
was profoundly impressed by their earnestness and devotion. There
is a large Y. M. C. A. at Tokyo and a smaller one at Kyoto; at Kagoshima
I found a Women's Christian Association. While I have met
American missionaries everywhere, I have tried to gather information
from Japanese sources as well and have been gratified to find such
cordial co-operation between foreign and native Christians. A
physician in the navy introduced himself and volunteered the information
that one American woman had undertaken the establishment
of Christian clubs at the various naval stations, and within
five years had gathered together more than five hundred members.
He said that she met with opposition from the authorities at first,
but now has their hearty support. The war with Russia, while retarding
the work of the Greek Church among the Japanese, has been
utilized by other denominations to reach a large number of sailors
with Bibles and pamphlets.</p>

<p>Japan needs the Christian religion; a nation must have some religion
and she has outgrown Buddhism. The ideals presented by
these two systems are in many respects diametrically opposed to each
other. One looks forward, the other backward; one regards life as
a blessing to be enjoyed and an opportunity to be improved, the
other sees in it only evil from which escape should be sought; one
crowns this life with immortality, the other adds to a gloomy existence
the darker night of annihilation; one offers faith as the inspiration
to noble deeds, the other presents a plan for the perfecting of
self with no sense of responsibility to God to prompt it or promise of
reward to encourage it; one enlarges the sympathies and links each
individual with all other human beings, the other turns the thought
inward in search of perpetual calm.</p>

<p>Christianity dominates Europe and the western hemisphere, while
Buddhism still holds the Orient under its drowsy spell. On the
islands of Japan a struggle is now going on between these two great
religious systems, and the triumph of the Gospel of Love and of consecrated
activity in the Land of the Rising Sun will open the way to
a still larger triumph in Asia.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>EDUCATION AND RELIGION</h3>


<p>The government of Japan is a constitutional monarchy in which
the emperor not only claims to rule by divine right but by right of
divine birth. He is described as Heaven born, and according to the
accepted history there has been no break in the family line for
twenty-five hundred years. Among no people on earth has there
ever been more universal respect shown, or implicit obedience yielded,
to the reigning family. There never has been a revolt of any consequence
against the emperor, although there have been numerous
conflicts between the shoguns. For about twelve hundred years, from
670 to 1868, the shoguns were, however, the actual rulers, and while
they never questioned the sovereignty of the emperor, they did not
allow him to retain much more than the empty title.</p>

<p>The shoguns were military rulers and a number of them were men
of great force and executive ability. First, the Fujiwara family controlled
the country through the shogunate for nearly four hundred
years; then for a century the Taira and Minamoto families alternated
in the exercise of power; then came the Hojo family and others of
less importance until finally the Tokugawa family became supreme
in the shogunate and continued in power for something like three
hundred years. The emperor lived at Nara until about 1600, when
the capital was moved to Kyoto, where it remained until less than
forty years ago. Tokyo, on the other hand, was the seat of the shogun
power, and there is a very noticeable difference between the two
cities. The shoguns fortified their castles and required the feudal
lords to keep headquarters in Tokyo. One cannot go through the
palace in which the emperor lived permanently without noticing
how plain it is as compared with the castle (both at Kyoto) in which
the shogun resided for a few days during his annual call upon the
emperor. While it may seem strange that the real rulers never
attempted to become emperors in name, it only shows their intelligence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
for by not insisting upon the recognition of the royal family
they were probably more successful in maintaining the real authority
than they would have been had they questioned the divine right of the
immemorial rulers.</p>

<p>During the early part of the last century there began to be a reaction
against the shogun, and when he agreed to the treaties opening
the country to foreign intercourse, his action was taken advantage
of by the friends of the emperor. When the feudal lords of Choshu
attacked the foreign ships at Shimonoseki Strait, the shogun was
compelled to pay an indemnity of three million dollars and he attempted
to chastise the Choshu leaders. His forces were defeated and
he died soon afterward. The emperor seized upon this event and
with the aid of the influential lords of Choshu and Satsuma abolished
the shogunate in 1868. The new shogun accepted the situation without
a struggle and those of his followers who attempted a resistance
were soon routed.</p>

<p>Everything in modern Japan dates from 1868, which is called the
restoration. While in the restoration the emperor was acknowledged
as the sole and absolute ruler in whom all authority was vested, still
it was really the beginning of constitutional government, for the
emperor voluntarily promised his people a constitution, a promise
which was not finally fulfilled until 1889.</p>

<p>The fervor of patriotism that restored to the emperor his original
authority wrought wonders in Japan. The feudal lords came forward
and voluntarily turned their vast estates over to the emperor
and relinquished the authority which they had exercised over their
tenants; then they joined with the samurai (their former retainers)
in supporting the emperor in abolishing all social distinctions. From
that day to this the country has grown more and more democratic,
the reforms working from the upper classes down.</p>

<p>In 1889 the constitution promised by the emperor was promulgated.
It was prepared largely by Marquis Ito who visited Germany
and modeled the document after the Prussian constitution. The
legislative power is vested in a diet consisting of two houses, one resembling
the English house of lords, and the other resembling our
house of representatives. The upper house is composed of the princes
of the royal blood, marquises (these sit by virtue of their rank),
counts, viscounts and barons, selected from among their respective
classes, men of erudition or distinguished service appointed by the
emperor, and one representative from each prefecture or state, selected
by the highest taxpayers. The members of the diet, except those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
sit by virtue of their rank, receive two thousand yen (one thousand
dollars) per year. The members of the house of representatives are
divided among the states in proportion to the number of franchise
holders; last year they numbered three hundred and twenty-three
and were voted for by seven hundred and fifty-seven thousand franchise
holders. The franchise holders numbered less than ten per
cent of the men of voting age, there being a property qualification
which excludes from suffrage more than nine-tenths of the adult males.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 350px;"><a name="togo" id="togo"></a>
<img src="images/ill027.jpg" width="350" height="442" alt="togo" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">ADMIRAL TOGO.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The emperor appoints the governors of the various states, and
these need not be selected from the states over which they preside.
The emperor has the right to convoke and prorogue the diet and to
dissolve the house of representatives; he also has the right to issue
urgency ordinances when the diet is not in session, the same to be
submitted for approval to the next session.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>The constitution contains a bill of rights. Among other rights the
Japanese subjects shall enjoy freedom of religious belief "within
limits not prejudicial to peace and order and not antagonistic to their
duties as subjects," and "within the limits of law" they shall enjoy
"the liberty of speech, writing, publication, public meeting and association."
After the Tokyo riots which followed the announcement
of the treaty with Russia an urgency ordinance was issued restraining
the press and certain newspapers were suspended under this ordinance,
but it is probable that this urgency ordinance will be vigorously
discussed at the coming session of the diet.</p>

<p>The emperor is assisted in the discharge of his executive duties by
a prime minister and nine department ministers; besides these he has
the advice of a privy council, composed of elder statesmen, of which
Marquis Ito is now the president.</p>

<p>Each state has what corresponds to our legislature, and each city
has a council; both of these bodies are elective and to the city council
is entrusted the selection of the mayor.</p>

<p>They have a judiciary, federal and local, appointed for life, but
no jury system. Among the laws is one forbidding aliens to own
property, although this is avoided to some extent by long time leases.
There is also a law by which a debt descends with the property to
the oldest son, even though the debt may exceed the property.</p>

<p>Through the courtesy of Hon. N. W. McIvor, former consul general
at Yokohama, now engaged in the practice of international law,
I had an opportunity to meet a number of governors and congressmen
and found them, as a rule, an intelligent and accomplished body of
men, many of them having finished their education abroad. Their
most famous minister of finance, Count Matsukata, bore some resemblance
to J. Pierpont Morgan.</p>

<p>They have politics in Japan. The promise of a constitution seems
to have been given by the emperor before there was any general agitation
for it, but as about twenty-one years elapsed between the
making of the promise and the realization of the hopes excited by it,
there was a period of discussion. As early as 1874 several of the
ministers joined in a petition asking for the promulgation of the
promised constitution. Their memorial being disregarded they resigned
their offices and became the founders of a democratic party.
They called themselves liberals and their efforts resulted in an imperial
rescript issued in 1881, fixing 1889 as the date for the beginning
of constitutional government. Marquis Ito is now the leader of the
liberal party, which had one hundred and thirty members in the
house of representatives in 1904.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="diet" id="diet"></a>
<img src="images/ill028.jpg" width="400" height="576" alt="diet" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">PRESIDENT OF DIET&mdash;JAPAN.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In 1882 Count Okuma organized the progressive party, which had
last year a membership of ninety in the house of representatives.
This is known as the party of the opposition, Marquis Ito's party
being the power behind the throne. There is not as much difference
between the platforms of these parties as between the platforms of
the two leading parties of our country, but of the two Count Okuma's
party is the more radical. The count himself is a born leader and
exerts a large influence upon the politics of his country. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
premier some years ago he lost a leg by the explosion of a bomb,
thrown with murderous intent by a political opponent, but it did not
diminish his zeal in the prosecution of reforms. The fact that there
were in the last diet one hundred and thirty who styled themselves
independents shows that there is a considerable body to which the
opposition party can appeal when the minister makes an unpopular
move.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 399px;"><a name="baron" id="baron"></a>
<img src="images/ill029.jpg" width="399" height="526" alt="baron" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">BARON KENTARO KANEKO.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Besides the party organizations there are a number of societies
formed for the study of political questions. There are economic associations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
in a number of the cities, composed of the leading business
and professional men. I met the members of these societies at Tokyo,
Osaka and Nagoya and was impressed with the attention that they
are giving to economic problems. They have in Tokyo another organization
called the Political Economy Association which deals more
directly with matters of government. The society formed by the men
who were educated in America, known as the Friends of America
(Baron Kaneko is one of the leading members), takes a deep interest in
all matters relating to government and political economy.</p>

<p>The leading political question in Japan to-day, in so far as it affects
domestic affairs, is whether the cabinet shall be selected by the emperor,
regardless of the prevailing sentiment in the house, or be made to conform
to the will of the people as expressed through their representatives.
At present the emperor's councilors are chosen at his own discretion
and the states of Satsuma and Choshu have had a controlling influence
in the selection of the emperor's advisors. The democratic sentiment
of the country is at this time crystallizing in favor of the demand that
the emperor take for his premier the leader of the popular party, as the
king of England does. However much this reform may be delayed
by circumstances, it is bound to come if Japan is to recognize the rights
of the people to govern themselves.</p>

<p>In the cities, sanitation furnishes a most difficult problem. At
present there is little sewage, although there is a pressing need for it.</p>

<p>In the industrial development of Japan the people must meet the
problem of child labor and also consider the shortening of the length
of the working day. Women now work twelve hours in the factory
and one cannot see them and the children at toil without asking
whether Japan can afford to impair the strength of the next generation
for any advantage which may be derived from such long
hours and such youthful labor. This subject is likely to be brought
before the next session of the diet.</p>

<p>In some reforms Japan has moved more rapidly than the United
States. Wherever she has waterworks in her cities, they are owned
and operated by the municipalities. She also has a telegraph system
and a telephone system operated by the national government. Telegrams
are sent at the same rate to all parts of the empire and the
service is satisfactory.</p>

<p>The telephone service is not so good. While it is all right as far
as it goes, the system is not extended as rapidly as the demand requires.
In Tokyo, for instance, those who want to install telephones
have to wait until someone discontinues his 'phone or is willing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
sell it, and a bonus is often demanded. If the local telephones were
owned by the city and only the interurban lines managed by the
imperial government, the service would respond more quickly to the
needs of the community.</p>

<p>The Japanese government also owns and operates a part of the
railroad system, and in doing so employs nothing but native help.
I traveled on both the government and private lines and could not
see that they differed materially so far as efficiency was concerned.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="okura" id="okura"></a>
<img src="images/ill030.jpg" width="400" height="496" alt="okura" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">MR. OKURA, A SUCCESSFUL JAPANESE BUSINESS MAN.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The first-class fare is about four cents per mile (in our money)
the second-class about two cents and the third-class (nearly all the
travel is third-class) about one cent. A reduction of twenty per cent
is made on return tickets, a reduction of from twenty to thirty per
cent on commutation tickets, and a reduction of from forty-five to
eighty per cent on season tickets for students. This reduction to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
students might be imitated to advantage in our country. The government
road is all, or nearly all, double track and has the latest
safeguards for the protection of passengers at depots. The Japanese
are much given to meeting friends when they arrive and escorting
them to the train when they leave, and this custom has led to the
sale of platform tickets for one cent (in our money).</p>

<p>Japan has two educational problems: First, the increase in the
percentage of those going from the primary to the middle schools;
and, second, the cultivation of an ideal which will connect a respect
for manual labor with intellectual advancement. To-day a large majority
of her people work with their hands and at labor which forbids
the wearing of good clothes. It is probable that the education of the
masses will show itself to some extent in improved methods and in
the more extensive use of animals and machinery, but there must
remain a large amount of work which requires daily contact with
the soil. The rice crop grows in the mud and cannot be harvested
by machinery; the fields, too, are so small that they cannot well be
cultivated with the aid of animals. The farmers' boys and girls are
now going to school and gradually adopting the European dress.
Will they be content to return to the paddy fields when they have
finished their education? Some of the young men pull 'rikishas in
the daytime in order to earn money to attend school at night. Will
their learning make them unwilling to do hard work? Or will they
substitute the cab for the 'rikisha?</p>

<p>Japan faces the educational problem that confronts the civilized
world, viz., how to put behind a trained mind an ideal which will
make the educated citizen anxious to do service rather than to be
waited upon. Tolstoy's solution of the problem is "bread labor,"
that is, physical toil sufficient to produce what one eats. This he
believes will teach respect for labor and by dignifying it unite all
parts of society in sympathetic co-operation. Has any better solution
been proposed?</p>

<p>With a broader educational foundation Japan will find it necessary
to extend the suffrage. At present the right to vote is determined by
a strict property qualification, but there is already an urgent demand
for the reduction of the tax qualification, and it will not be long before
a large addition will be made to the voting population.</p>

<p>The most serious national problem with which Japan has to deal
is that imposed upon her by the attempt to extend the sphere of her
political influence to Formosa on the southwest and Korea on the
northwest. The people of Formosa do not welcome Japanese sovereignty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
and an army of some six or seven thousand is kept on that
island to support Japanese authority.</p>

<p>But Korea presents a still more delicate and perplexing situation.
For more than a thousand years a feud has existed between Japan
and Korea and two attempts have been made by the former to invade
the latter, the last about three hundred years ago. At that time a
number of captives were carried back to Kagoshima where they, as
before mentioned, introduced the art of making what has since been
known as Satsuma ware. The fact that the descendants of these
captives lived in a colony by themselves for three centuries without
intermarrying with the Japanese is sufficient evidence of the feeling
entertained toward them by their captors.</p>

<p>To aggravate the matter Japan has been engaged in two wars, first
with China and then with Russia, over Korea, and it was also the
cause of one civil war in Japan. Having driven China from Korea
ten years ago and now having driven Russia out, she is undertaking
to exercise a protectorate over the country. When it is remembered
that Korea is separated from both Manchuria and Siberia by an imaginary
line and that the Koreans themselves regard the Japanese as
intruders, some estimate can be formed of Japan's task. In a future
article on Korea I shall speak on this subject more at length, but the
matter is referred to here because the experiment is as dangerous to
Japan as it is to Korea.</p>

<p>Will Japan be able to accomplish what other nations have failed
to do, viz., exercise a colonial power without abusing it and without
impoverishing herself?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>KOREA&mdash;"THE HERMIT NATION."</h3>


<p>Poor little Korea! One hardly knows whether to be amused or
grieved, so strangely have comedy and tragedy been blended in her
history.</p>

<p>Mr. Griffiths in his very comprehensive book bearing that title, calls
Korea the "Hermit Nation," and the appellation was a fitting one until
within a generation. Since that time she might be described as a
bone of contention, for she has been the cause of several bloody quarrels.</p>

<p>The position of Korea on the map of Asia very much resembles
Florida's position on the map of North America, and Japan's relative
position is something like that which Cuba bears to Florida. Separated
on the south from Japan by about a hundred miles of water and joining
both China and Russia on the north, it is not strange that all three of
these nations have looked upon her with covetous eyes and begrudged
each other any advantage obtained. The surface of Korea is quite
mountainous, the ranges and valleys extending for the most part from
the northeast to the southwest. Until recently the country was inaccessible
and few of the white race have penetrated the interior. A few years
ago a railroad was built from Seoul thirty-five miles west to Chemulpo,
the nearest seaport. Since then the Japanese have built a road from
Seoul north to Pen Yang, and southeast to Fusan. The last line, which
has been finished less than a year, is two hundred and seventy-five miles
long and connects the Korean capital with the nearest seaport to Japan.
This railroad is of such great military importance to Japan that she
aided the building to the extent of guaranteeing six per cent interest on
the investment for fifteen years, with the provision that the cost of the
road should not exceed twenty-five million yen. The Korean government
gave the right of way for the road and the free admission of material
imported for its construction and equipment. The engines and
cars are of American style and make, and the road is standard gauge.
It is now so easy to pass through Korea in going from Japan to Pekin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
that the tourist should not miss its strange and interesting sights, but
the trip should be made before November. We took the train at Fusan
and made the ride nearly all the way in daylight, thus having an opportunity
to see both the country and the people. The road crosses three
rivers and the water sheds which separate them, making the construction
of the road extremely difficult. The mountains are bare, and we
were informed that they had been denuded by the natives and the wood
used for fuel. The Koreans sometimes blame the Japanese for the appearance
of the country and attributed it to the invasion three hundred
years ago; an intelligent
son of Japan
replied that as his
country recovered
from earthquake
shocks within a few
years, the Koreans
should have been
able to remove the
traces of an invasion
in less than three
centuries.</p>

<p>The valleys are
fertile but in tillage
and in evidences of
industry they do not
approach the valleys
of Japan. One
misses the orchards,
the trees, the vines
and the flowers
which are ever present
in "The Land of
the Rising Sun."</p>

</div>

<p>Rice is the principal
crop in the south,
while barley and wheat are more cultivated in the north. Beans and
peas are also raised in large quantities and last year constituted the
chief article of export. Rice, while often the largest export, fell below
beans and peas that year and was closely followed by hides and ginseng.
There are some gold mines, the export of this ore amounting
to nearly fifty thousand dollars last year, but the country has been
so isolated that its mineral wealth has not been exhaustively explored.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>The population of Korea is variously estimated at from eight to
fifteen millions. The men are larger than the Japanese and somewhat
lighter in color but not so alert. Like the Japanese they have rather a
scanty beard, but it seems to be more fashionable for the older men to
allow their chin whiskers to grow. In dress the Korean man is unique.
He wears a long white coat of thin cotton reaching to the knees, with
trousers generally of white, very full in the seat and tied around the
ankles. The vest is of red, blue or green if he is not in mourning, but
mourning seems to be a permanent occupation in Korea. It was explained
to us that white is the color used for mourning and that the
mourning period lasts three years. When one of the royal family dies,
all of the people wear mourning for the full period, and as they have
sometimes had three royal funerals within a decade, white came into
general use as a matter of economy.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="korea" id="korea"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">IN KOREA&mdash;GROUP OF NATIVES.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The hat ordinarily worn is made of horse hair and has a high crown,
and being only about a third as large as our hats, it sits upon the top of
the head without covering it. It has a narrow brim of the same material<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
and is tied on with strings under the chin. These hats are generally
black, although different colors may be seen upon the street; sometimes
an enormous straw hat is used for mourning.</p>

<p>The unmarried men wear the hair in one long braid like a Chinese
pigtail, but when one marries he combs his hair to the top of his head
and ties it in a stiff top knot which is visible through the gauze hat.
The foot is encased in a sock, padded with cotton, and a canoe shaped
shoe of grass, cloth, leather or wood.</p>

<p>The women, except those of the coolie class, are seldom seen on the
street in the daytime, and the men are not allowed on the street at night,
or were not until western ways began to invade the island. Even when
going out the women wear over their heads a green cape with scarlet
sleeves and draw it across the face in such a way that little more than
the eyes can be seen. The streets of Seoul and of the towns through
which we passed were full of men, many of them walking about in a
leisurely way or standing in groups smoking long pipes. Mingled with
them were coolies carrying immense packs on their backs or leading
ponies, oxen or cows laden with hay, wood or fagots. We saw more idle
men in two days in Korea than we saw in Japan in a month. While
the coolies seem to be quite industrious and carry astonishing weights,
there seems to be a deep-rooted contempt for labor&mdash;even among the
middle classes, and a contractor told us that in the employing of the
coolies it was necessary to pay them every day because a week's compensation
would have to be spent before they would return to work. An
incident will serve to illustrate the feeling in regard to labor of any
kind. In making a purchase we wanted two things tied together with
a string. We called the guide's attention to it; he handed the things to
his attendant and the attendant handed them to the shopkeeper, who
did the tying. We were also informed that the Koreans lack the power
of organized co-operation. Each one works by himself and carries his
burden on forked sticks strapped to his back. In walking he uses what
seems like a staff, but its real purpose is that of a prop for his load when
he stops to rest.</p>

<p>The shopkeepers of Korea have the oriental taste for bargaining to a
marked degree and always ask a great deal more than they expect to
receive, finding, apparently, intellectual recreation in haggling over the
price. In making a few small purchases we were very much amused at
the spirited discussions which took place between our guide and the
merchants. Followed by a crowd of interested spectators, numbering
from twenty to fifty, we moved from shop to shop. The vendor would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
announce a price as if his was a one-price store. The guide would
receive the announcement with absolute contempt and the wordy war
would begin. The bystanders took sides and joined in the fray; the
clerks and members of the storekeeper's family flocked to his aid,
while the crowd elbowed each other to get nearer the scene of action.
Usually the guide would start toward another store before an agreement
could be reached, sometimes less than half of the original price
was settled upon, and in the calm which followed the storm, everyone
seemed satisfied. We heard of instances where one-eighth of the
price asked was finally accepted, but either the merchants with whom
we dealt were more reasonable or our guide yielded too soon.</p>

<p>The Korean houses are entirely different from those of Japan; they
are not so high nor so large but are more warmly built. They are
usually constructed of stone set in mud and have poorly thatched roofs
of straw; occasionally tile is used. Often the earth supplies a floor
except for the little sleeping rooms, which have floors of stone covered
with oiled paper. These rooms are heated by flues under the floors
which conduct the flame and smoke to a chimney which opens on the
side of the house. Leaves, fagots, coarse grass and all sorts of trash are
used for fuel and these stone floors, heated twice a day, keep the small
rooms quite comfortable.</p>

<p>The people sit on the floor as in Japan, except that they sit cross-legged
instead of sitting on the feet, and sleep on mats spread on the
floor at night and stowed away during the day.</p>

<p>While in Seoul we were, through the courtesy of Rev. S. F. Moore,
one of the missionaries, invited to the wedding of two Korean Christians
and after the ceremony had a chance to inspect the house of the groom's
father. It was quite neat and clean, but the houses generally as seen
from the narrow streets are dirty and uninviting. One wonders where
the men keep the long white coats of which they seem so proud, until
he is informed that the wives wash and iron them at night while the
lord of the household sleeps.</p>

<p>Speaking of the marriage, I must as a truthful chronicler record
that the young man whom we saw married (they marry young in Korea
and the marriages are arranged by the parents) had a pleasant face and
that the bride was modest and comely. He wore a dark red, loose-fitting
coat, a wide belt and a black gauze hat of indescribable shape.
The girl wore a green silk waist which, just below the armpits, joined a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a><br /><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
very full skirt of red. Her head was ornamented with two very large
rolls of hair which, according to custom, were borrowed for the occasion.
We were informed that the wedding clothes are often rented and that
even the goose, which in the native ceremony the wife presents to the
husband as a symbol of constancy, is obtained in the same way. As in
this case the Christian ceremony was used, the couple did not pledge
themselves according to the native practice by saying "Black is the
hair that now crowns our heads, yet when it has become as white as the
fibers of the onion root, we shall still be found faithful to each other,"
but as among the non-Christian Koreans the man is allowed to take
a concubine into his home whenever he is able to support one, the
pledge would seem to be a mere formality on his part.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><a name="scene" id="scene"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">A KOREAN SCENE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Seoul, the capital and largest city, is surrounded by a substantial wall
and entered by gates which until recently were shut at night even
though the city long ago outgrew the walls. These gates remind one of
the gates described in the Bible, and they are not lacking in the beggar
who finds the gate a convenient place to make his plea to the passerby.
Aside from two or three broad thoroughfares, the streets are narrow,
crooked and filthy. The open sewers on each side are filled with refuse
matter and reek with foul odors.</p>

<p>There is no general educational system in Korea, and the percentage
of illiteracy is naturally large. The missionary schools are doing an
excellent work and a few of the young men have been sent to China,
Japan and America. During recent years there has been quite an
awakening among the young men, and they are showing an increased
desire to learn about western civilization. So great is this interest that
a newly organized branch of the Young Men's Christian Association at
Seoul has a membership of over five hundred, four-fifths of whom are
not professing Christians but are drawn to the institution because it
gives them a chance to study western problems and methods. Mr.
Wanamaker, the merchant prince of Philadelphia, has just offered to
supply the money necessary for a permanent Y. M. C. A. building in
Seoul, and having addressed a meeting in the present crowded quarters,
I can testify that a new hall is badly needed.</p>

<p>The Chinese characters are used in writing, but the Koreans have a
spoken language which is quite different. There is no extensive literature
that can be called Korean, although Dr. Allen, for many years
American minister at Seoul, has published, in a volume entitled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
"Korea: Facts and Fancies," a number of delightful folklore stories,
which show an appreciation of the love story and a very clear recognition
of the personal virtues as illustrated in daily life. Dr. Allen's
book also contains an interesting chronology of the principal events,
but it is significant of the change wrought by foreign influence that
it only requires twelve pages to record the things worth mentioning
from the beginning of the Christian era down to 1876, while eighty
pages are devoted to the things that have transpired since.</p>

<p>In examining the pages devoted to the last century one is struck with
the disinclination of the Korean government to accept the offers of
intercourse made by the various nations of Europe since 1875, and with
the number of missionaries who suffered for religion's sake prior to that
date. Persecution, however, seems to have increased rather than diminished
the zeal of the various denominations, and to-day Korea is regarded
as one of the most promising of the missionary fields. While
Confucianism has influenced Korea, Buddhism never gained such a
foothold in this country as in China and Japan. There are no gorgeous
temples here, and for five hundred years (and until recently) Buddhist
priests were not allowed within the walls of Seoul. There are missionary
stations throughout the country, and at Peng Yang there is a native
congregation of fifteen hundred. At Seoul a modern hospital, built
with money given by Mr. Severance, of Cleveland, Ohio, has been
opened by Dr. Avison, where, besides care for the sick, medical training
is furnished to natives who desire to fit themselves for this profession.
I was assured by Dr. Avison and by missionaries that young Koreans,
both men and women, learn quickly and are faithful assistants. The
medical missionary, being in an excellent position to show his Christian
spirit by helpful service, is doing much to aid in the propagation of
our religion in the Orient. In this connection I might add that Dr.
Allen went to Korea as a medical missionary and became the emperor's
physician. This intimate relation gave our country a good standing
when the doctor afterward became the American minister. These
friendly relations are still maintained through present Minister Morgan.</p>

<p>The government of Korea is an absolute monarchy and has a reigning
family which has held the throne for about five hundred years. All
authority emanates from the emperor and is exercised through ministers,
governors and subordinate officials, appointed by him. If one can
trust the stories afloat, the government is as corrupt an organization as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
can be found on earth. Just who is responsible is not clearly known,
but that offices are sold and all sorts of extortion practiced there can
scarcely be doubt. There is no spirit of patriotism such as is to be
found in Japan, and why should there be when the government gives
so little in return for the burdens which it imposes?</p>

<p>Changes in the cabinet are of frequent occurrence, there having
been something like sixty within a year.</p>

<p>For a long time Chinese influence was paramount in Korea and the
Chinese government had a resident minister in Seoul who was the confidential
advisor of the royal family. But Chinese influence ended with
Japan's victory in 1894; soon afterward Queen Min, the wife of the
present emperor, was put to death and, the murder being charged to
the Japanese, the emperor took refuge at the Russian legation. Now
that Japan has driven Russia out, she is virtually in control of the
country, although the nominal sovereignty of the emperor has not
been interfered with. Just what form the Japanese protectorate will
take has not yet been decided, or at least has not yet been announced.
Marquis Ito is in Seoul now as the representative of his government
conferring with the emperor and his ministry.</p>

<p>In the end the protectorate will be whatever Japan desires to have it,
for neither Korea nor Russia nor China is in a position to question her
decision. Besides building railroads through Korea, the Japanese have
established banks and issued a currency for Korea in place of the copper
cash generally used. The government, recognizing the inconvenience
of a currency which had to be kept in huge boxes and paid
out at the rate of a thousand or more to the dollar, had farmed out the
right to coin nickels and these were soon counterfeited. The counterfeit
nickels have been classified as, first, better than the originals; second,
good imitations; third, poor imitations; and fourth, those that
can only be passed on a dark night.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">AMERICAN HOSPITAL AT SEOUL&mdash;KOREA</p></div>
</div>

<p>Japanese soldiers are to be seen everywhere and Japanese settlements
are to be found in all the larger cities. The Koreans, as a rule, regard
the new Japanese invasion with silent distrust and are in doubt whether
the purpose of Japan is simply to protect herself from future danger at
the hands of China and Russia, or whether she is expecting to colonize
Korea with her own people. If Japan purifies the government and
makes it honest; if she establishes schools and raises the intellectual
standard of the people; if she revives the industries now fallen into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a><br /><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
decay and introduces new ones; if, in other words, she exercises her
power for the upbuilding of Korea and for the advancement of the
Korean people, she may in time overcome the prejudice which centuries
of hostility have created. But what nation has ever exercised power in
this way? And how can Japan do it without developing an educated
class which will finally challenge her authority? If she keeps the
Koreans in ignorance and poverty, they will be sullen subjects; if she
leads them to higher levels they will the more quickly demand their
independence and be the better prepared to secure it. Which course will
she pursue?<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>CHINA&mdash;AS SHE WAS</h3>


<p>The contrast between the China of antiquity&mdash;hoary with age&mdash;and
the new China&mdash;just awakening into life&mdash;is so great as to suggest the
treatment of the two periods in different articles. And if the contrast
between China of yesterday and the China of to-day is great, what shall
we say of the contrast between the Flowery Kingdom and our own
country? The same stars shine overhead and the same laws of nature
operate on the earth, but in mode of living, appearance, customs and
habits of thought, the Chinese people could scarcely be more different
from ours.</p>

<p>First, a word as to the land which they occupy; its very vastness impresses
one, unless he has recently consulted his geography. While the
eighteen provinces which constitute China proper have something less
than two million square miles, yet the Chinese empire with its tributary
states has an area of about five million three hundred thousand square
miles, and extends over thirty degrees north and south and seventy degrees
east and west. We hardly realize when we speak of China that her
emperor holds sway over a territory nearly twice as large as the United
States; that his decrees are law to a population estimated at from two
hundred and fifty to four hundred millions; that her climate is like
that of Russia in the north, while in the southern provinces her people
live under a tropical sun; and that she has so many mountains and such
mighty deserts that more than half of her population is crowded
together upon a plain which contains but a little more than two hundred
thousand square miles. Williams, in his work entitled "The
Middle Kingdom," calls this district "the most densely settled of any
part of the world of the same size," and estimates that upon this plain&mdash;less
than three times the size of Nebraska&mdash;one hundred and seventy-seven
millions of human beings dwell.</p>

<p>The harbors of China are hardly what one might expect on so extended
a line of sea coast. While the harbor at Hong Kong is an admirable
one&mdash;one of the best in the world&mdash;the one at Shanghai has no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
hills to protect it, the one at Chefoo is open to the storms and the one
at Taku does not deserve to be called a harbor at all. In leaving Shanghai
we went an hour and a half by launch in order to reach a steamer
of only six thousand tons; at Chefoo a still smaller ship was delayed a
day because the lighters could not unload it in the wind, and at Taku,
the seaport of Tientsin and Pekin, we spent a day on the bar waiting for
ten feet of water.</p>

<p>The capital of the empire has until recently been so difficult of access
that comparatively few tourists have visited it. The large ocean steamers
stop at Shanghai and Hong Kong only, making it necessary for one
desiring to visit Pekin to take a smaller boat and risk indefinite delays
on account of wind and tide.</p>

<p>Since the completion of the railroad from Hankow to Pekin it is
possible to accomplish the journey from Shanghai to Pekin in less time,
and, in addition, enjoy the advantage of a trip inland. When the projected
road is completed from Hankow to Canton, the tourist can land
at Shanghai, take a river boat six hundred miles up the Yangste Kiang
to Hankow, then go by rail to Pekin, about eight hundred miles north,
then back through Hankow to Canton nearly as far south, from which
point there are daily boats to Hong Kong. This trip, covering nearly
a thousand miles of river travel and about fifteen hundred miles of railroad
travel (not including the return trip from Pekin to Hankow)
can be made in the time formerly spent in travel along the coast and
furnishes an infinitely better opportunity for the study of the country
and the people. As a matter of precaution I ought to add that Pekin
is so far north that before the opening of the railroad it was extremely
difficult to visit it after the first of December, and even now it is desirable
that the trip should be made before the middle of November.</p>

<p>China is well watered; the largest river, the Yantse Kiang, which
empties into the ocean at Shanghai, is three thousand miles long, drains
more than half a million square miles. Seven hundred miles above
its mouth carries a volume of water estimated at five hundred thousand
cubic feet per second. It is one of the great rivers of the earth
and is navigable for large vessels for more than a thousand miles.</p>

<p>The Yellow river, or, in Chinese, the Hwang Ho, drains a basin
almost as large and is nearly as long, but does not carry so large a
volume of water. This is the river whose overflows have been so disastrous
as to earn for it the name of "The Great Sorrow." This river
carries down so much deposit that within recent times it has choked
its original outlet and formed a new channel, entering the ocean some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a><br /><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
three hundred miles farther north. At that time thousands of villages
were swept away and the loss of life was estimated at several
millions. The current of the Yellow river is so shifting, the sandbars
so numerous and the volume of water so changeable that the river is
practically useless for navigation.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><a name="group" id="group"></a>
<img src="images/ill037.jpg" width="600" height="351" alt="group" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">A GROUP OF CHINESE&mdash;PEKIN</p></div>
</div>

<p>Besides these, there are a number of rivers of less importance and
tributaries of these two large rivers, which only seem small by comparison.</p>

<p>As if inspired by the numerous and extensive natural waterways,
the Chinese people centuries ago connected the great water systems by
an immense canal, which with the streams utilized by it, gave water
communication between Pekin and Canton. This canal, sometimes
known as the Transit river, is nearly twice as long as the Erie canal
and is not only the greatest work of its kind in Asia, but at the time
of its construction was the greatest in the world.</p>

<p>Before speaking of the people, a word should be said in regard to
the great wall. It extends from the ocean westward along the northern
boundary of China proper for a distance of about fifteen hundred
miles, climbing in its tortuous course hills and mountains, one
more than five thousand feet high. It is about twenty-five feet thick
at the base and fifteen at the top and varies from fifteen to thirty
feet in height. It is made of earth with a shell of stone or large brick
to hold the earth in place. The watch towers, built at intervals along
the line, add to its imposing appearance and make it an object of
historic interest, although a large part of the wall has fallen into decay
and in some places only a ridge of dirt remains. This wall was constructed
about two hundred years before the Christian era as a protection
against the hostile tribes of the north, and for many centuries
it answered its purpose, although to-day it only suggests a tremendous
waste of labor.</p>

<p>But the great wall, imposing as it is because of its length, is inferior
in height, thickness and construction to some of the city walls. The
wall of the city of Pekin, for instance, is about sixty feet high and
forty feet wide at its base, and is kept in excellent repair. The wall
encloses what is known as the Tartar city and is nearly four miles
square. Huge watch towers rise above each gate, and to give still
greater security, the gates open into an enclosed square. While the
walls of the city of Pekin are the most substantial in the empire, the
walls of Nanking, the former capital, enclose nearly four times as
much ground. There was a double object in making the walls of
the city so extensive. First, to provide for future growth; and, second,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a><br /><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
to enable the people to withstand a longer siege. How well the
second purpose was served is shown by the fact that during the Taiping
rebellion the city of Nanking was besieged for thirteen years.
Just outside the walls of the city may still be seen the earthworks
thrown up by the imperial army, which sometimes numbered thirty-five
thousand.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE WALL AT PEKIN</p></div>
</div>

<p>But it must not be understood that the capital cities were the only
ones protected by walls. On the contrary, all the cities are walled;
one sees fifteen or twenty of these walled cities on the railroad from
Pekin to Hankow and a number of others on the ride down the river
to Shanghai.</p>

<p>The agricultural population, instead of occupying individual farms,
as in America, is gathered into little villages, each home being enclosed
in its own wall. During the summer the people swarm out
from the cities and villages and cultivate their little tracts of land
with the most primitive tools, carrying the farm products back to
their homes on wheelbarrows or in baskets balanced on poles. In
the north of China the camel is used for long distance travel, and in
the south we saw the water buffalo drawing the plow, but in China
less than anywhere else we have been, has man supplemented his
strength by the strength of domestic animals.</p>

<p>In the cities the streets are so narrow that travel by ordinary vehicles
is impossible. In Pekin there are a few wide streets leading
from the gates through the city, and on these a peculiar heavy-wheeled,
springless cart is used, but most of the streets are more like
alleys in which two 'rikishas can hardly pass. We did not see a full
sized horse in the capital city. Some ponies have been brought down
from Manchuria (Manchuria is regarded as the personal property of
the imperial family and there is a royal monopoly in ponies) but the
most popular saddle animal is the patient donkey. It looks ludicrous
to see a fat Chinaman perched upon the rump of one of these tiny
beasts, but there seems to be entire harmony between the two and the
donkey trudges along with little thought of change.</p>

<p>In Canton the streets are not wide enough for the 'rikisha, and
both the pony and the donkey are conspicuous by their absence. The
sedan chair, borne by coolies, was the only conveyance we saw in a
day's tour of the city, and it required some engineering to make any
headway with it when two parties met.</p>

<p>Although the business buildings are seldom more than two stories
high (the residences are usually only one story), the streets are so
narrow and so filled with signs and advertising banners that the sun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a><br /><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
can scarcely find its way to the pavement. The stores are narrow little
stalls with the entire front open to the street. Often there is a little
shrine outside the door where incense is burned, and innumerable
gods of wood, brass and stone are to be seen.</p>

<p>While in their style of dress and in their institutions the Chinese
are much the same throughout the empire, they differ considerably
in size and color according to the latitude, and in features according
to race history. In the north the people are lighter and larger than
in the south, while the men and women of Manchuria have coarser
and stronger faces than the Chinese. The people in the north seem
to be more vigorous
and warlike
and less artistic
than the people of
the south.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">CHINESE EMPEROR.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The shaved
forehead and the
queue were prescribed
by the
Manchurian rulers
two hundred
and fifty years
ago as a sign of
subjection, but
they are now a
source of pride,
and no greater
humiliation can
be inflicted upon
one than to cut
off his queue. In
the northern
provinces the
men, women and
children wear
padded clothes,
generally of dark
blue cotton. The
breeches of the men are tied at the ankles and the long, narrow coat
reaches almost to the feet. In China the women also wear trousers,
but they are more like the American article and the coat worn by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
the women is considerably shorter than that worn by the men. China
is a great place for furs, and the right to wear sable is conferred as
a mark of distinction upon the higher officials.</p>

<p>The Manchu women and the Chinese women differ materially. The
Manchus, whose ancestors came from Manchuria, still retain the customs
peculiar to their section. The hair is stretched over a broad,
winglike frame and three hours are required for its arrangement.
Flowers, natural and artificial, and ornaments made of feathers, beads
and tinsel are profusely used in hair decoration. The Manchu women,
except the widows, employ paint and powder with a boldness which
would put to shame the most inveterate user of cosmetics in America.
In the painting here there is no suggestion of a delicate glow of
health; it is a generous application of bright red in two streaks, running
from above the eyes to the corners of the mouth. The rest of
the face is whitened with rice
powder, which does not harmonize
with the yellow skin
of the neck.</p>

<p>But if the Manchu women
show more vanity in the
treatment of the face, they
at least do not imitate the
Chinese women in the binding
of the feet, though by
wearing skirts and a shoe
resting on a block, shaped
like a French heel, the size
of the foot is concealed.</p>

</div>

<p>Foot-binding is probably
the strangest form that
human pride has ever taken,
and it is hard to believe that
Chinese women from time
immemorial have endured
the agonies of foot-binding
and forced it upon their
daughters. It is not known certainly how the custom originated. One
tradition is that it began with a club-footed queen; another that it was
designed to distinguish the upper class women from the coolies; and
a third tradition has it that it was a scheme devised by the men for
keeping the women at home. But whatever causes may have led to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a><br /><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the inauguration of the custom, it has become so firmly established that
a prominent Chinaman told me that being opposed to foot-binding, he
had, when a young man, tried to find a wife with natural feet but was
not able to do so. He has in recent years persuaded his wife to unbind
her feet and has kept his daughters from undergoing the ordeal.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">EMPRESS DOWAGER&mdash;CHINA</p></div>
</div>

<p>The process, as described by a physician and as shown in a photograph
and model which I secured, is as follows: At the age of five
or six the little girl's feet are tightly bandaged; the second, third,
fourth and fifth toes being gradually brought back under the sole of
the foot; the heel is then drawn forward under the instep and the
natural growth of the foot entirely arrested. The medical missionaries
report instances in which the foot has rotted away because of lack of
circulation. On one of the boats we met an intelligent Chinese merchant
who, after condemning the practice of foot-binding and telling
us that, in opposition to his wife's wishes and in opposition to
the girl herself, he had saved one daughter from foot-binding, compared
this custom to that of lacing, affirming that the latter was
much more injurious. He also ventured to suggest that Chinese women
do not expose their health and their shoulders in decollete gowns, but
perceiving that he had discovered a weak spot in our own social armor,
I hurriedly changed the subject. But I must reserve for another
article the discussion of other characteristics.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3>CHINA&mdash;AS SHE WAS.</h3>

<h4>PART SECOND.</h4>


<p>In the first article on China, reference was made to some of the
characteristics of the Chinese, but the subject was not exhausted&mdash;in
fact, it would require several articles to exhaust this subject, and
attention can only be given to those traits or customs which are in
most violent contrast with our own.</p>

<p>Chinese society is patriarchal in its organization, the family being
the unit and the father the head of the family. The Chinese sages
present filial piety and fraternal submission as the root of all benevolent
action. The children are subject to the parents as long as the
parents live, and the younger sons are subject to the eldest. The
four relations which are continually discussed by the philosophers are:
First, the relation between the king and his ministers; second, between
the father and his sons; third, between the elder brother and
the younger brothers; fourth, between the individual and his fellows,
but the fourth relation receives the least consideration.</p>

<p>Marriages are arranged by the parents, and the children must be
content with the selection made. When the wife is taken to the home
of the husband, she becomes a member of his family and subject to
her mother-in-law, if the husband's mother is still alive. As other
sons are married their wives are brought in and they are expected to
live peaceably together&mdash;an expectation which is not always fully
realized. As law and custom permit the system of concubinage, it is
not strange that the home is often the scene of contention rather
than the center of felicity.</p>

<p>As the duty of sacrificing to ancestors falls upon the son, the advent
of a boy is the signal for rejoicing, while the birth of a girl is not
considered a good omen. So unpopular was the female baby that in
some provinces many of them were formerly put to death, but child-murder
is now on the decrease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>No one can visit China without becoming acquainted with a peculiarly
oriental phrase called "losing face." One of the first newspapers
that I picked up in China described the attempted suicide of
a man who complained that he had "lost his face" because a magistrate
refused to commence a prosecution on his complaint. In China
there is a constant effort to keep up appearances, and when this is no
longer possible, the unfortunate one feels that he can not look anyone
else in the face. Chinese life is saturated with this "face" doctrine;
it percolates through their disputes and oozes out through the pores of
their diplomacy. Justice is of less importance in the deciding of a
controversy than the saving of the parties from the loss of "face."
There are in each community "peace-talkers" who make a business of
so adjusting disputes that neither party will seem to be in the wrong.</p>

<p>In dealing with China this national characteristic must be borne in
mind, and it is to be regretted that foreign nations have in their negotiations
sometimes imitated China instead of setting her a better example.
One constantly meets over here with the theory that the foreigner
must conform to the methods of the Orient, but this is always
advanced as an excuse for following a bad custom. It is impossible to
convince China that our ideal is a better one than hers unless that
ideal is embodied in action. When our country admitted that the indemnity
collected from Japan after the Shimonoseki affair was excessive,
and returned it, she made a deep impression upon the Japanese. It
was several times referred to by speakers during our recent visit to
Japan as an evidence of our country's desire to do justice to other nations.
It was just as honorable for a nation to acknowledge an error
as it is for an individual to do so, and our nation has an opportunity
to admit another excessive demand and return to China a part of the
indemnity collected at the close of the Boxer trouble.</p>

<p>No nation has ever given more emphasis to ceremony than does
China. Confucius places propriety among the cardinal virtues, and
the doctrine has been elaborated until the whole life is fettered by
formality. Each rising generation is drilled in the performance of
certain rites required by approved etiquette, and it would be humiliating
for one to have to confess that he did not know the proper thing
to do and the proper way to do it. Even sincerity is considered much
less important, and both Confucius and Mencius set demoralizing
examples in placing the latter above the former. In the Analects,
an instance is given where one, Joo Pei, wished to see Confucius, but
the latter refused to see him "on the ground of being sick." When
the bearer of the message had left, Confucius "took his harpsicord,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
and sang to it, in order that Pei might hear him." It is related of
Mencius that he was about to go to court to see the king when he received
a message from the king saying that the latter "was wishing
to call on Mencius but was detained by a cold." Mencius replied,
"Unfortunately, I am unwell and unable to go to court," but the
next day he went out and paid a visit of condolence to another family.
While he was absent from the house the king's messenger called with
a physician, whereupon the representative of Mencius explained that
he was sick the day before, but that being a little better he had
hastened to court. It was then necessary to send out several men to
intercept Mencius and get him to the king's house. All of this subterfuge
was resorted to in order to get the king to call upon Mencius first.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="boats" id="boats"></a>
<img src="images/ill044.jpg" width="450" height="284" alt="boats" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">HOUSE BOATS AT CANTON.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The kowtow is still a part of the ceremonial greeting. If two
officials are riding and meet, they dismount and bow their heads to
the ground. In the schools the students kowtow before a Confucian
tablet twice each month. When we visited the government school
at Shanghai we noticed mats upon the floor of the otherwise empty
assembly hall, and upon inquiry learned that at seven the next morning
the students would perform the usual Confucian rites. These
consist of a series of kowtows. At a given signal the students kneel
on the mats and bow three times toward the tablet, their heads each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
time touching the floor; they then rise and after a short interval
kneel again at a signal and bow three times more. This ceremony is
again repeated, making nine bows in all. Then they kneel and bow
three times to the professors; after saluting the professors each student
bows once to the student next to him and the meeting adjourns.
We thought it would be interesting to witness this service in honor
of one who has received more formal reverence than any other mortal,
and arising before it was light, we made the journey to the college,
which is distant an hour's ride from the hotel. When we arrived
we found that for some reason which we could not ascertain, the
ceremony would not be performed. Whether the postponement was
due to objection to the presence of foreigners (visitors had been
present on former occasions) or to some other cause, was left in mystery.</p>

<p>Our morning ride, however, answered one purpose; as the road ran
some distance by the side of a little stream, it enabled us to see something
of houseboat life. Hundreds of little boats line the stream, and
in their diminutive mat-covered cabins were housed thousands of
natives, many of whom are born, live and die in these unstable homes.
As they were preparing the morning meal we had a chance to confirm
the stories regarding their want of cleanliness. It was not an
uncommon thing to see a woman washing rice in the muddy water
and a few feet away, another woman throwing refuse matter into
the stream, or a man performing his morning ablutions. At Canton
one has a still larger opportunity to observe houseboat life where the
Pearl river furnishes the water supply and at the same time an open
sewer for a floating population of many thousands.</p>

<p>The contrast between the bath-loving Japanese and the dirty, complacent
Chinese laborer is very marked and this contrast is also noticeable
in the streets. The sights and smells that greet the senses along
the narrow streets of a native city are not soon forgotten by one who
travels through China, and one's ideas of modesty, too, are sadly
wrenched.</p>

<p>But whatever may be said of the habits of the lower class Chinese,
they are an industrious and patient people. After watching them
work and observing the conditions under which they live, one can
scarcely begrudge them whatever comfort they can find in the dreams
of Heaven which they draw from their opium pipes. And speaking
of opium, one is restrained from speaking too harshly of the habit
by a recollection of the fact that the opium trade was forced upon the
"Heathen Chinee" by a great Christian nation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>The Chinese have their amusements, one of which is the theatre.
We attended one theatre in Pekin and found the room crowded with
men. It was a commodious hall with a gallery, but the stage was
not relatively so large as in Japan. The acting reminded us more of
the American stage than did the Japanese, but the scenery was exceedingly
scanty. The audience expressed itself in approval or disapproval
with a good deal of freedom.</p>

<p>We found a sport in China which we have not heard of elsewhere,
viz., quail fighting. These little birds are matched against each other
as fighting cocks are in the Spanish countries. One American told
us of a fight between cockroaches. These combats, as well as those
between the quails, give an opportunity for betting&mdash;a vice which
prevails in the Orient as well as in the Occident.</p>

<p>The Chinese have a bird contest which involves neither cruelty nor
bloodshed, although the element of gambling is also present in it.
I refer to the singing matches between larks. The Chinese are very
fond of birds and one cannot go upon the street without seeing men
carrying bird cages. The birds are aired much as pet dogs are exercised
in our country. The favorite singing bird is the lark, and these
are entered by their owners in contests, considerable sums often being
placed upon a bird. The award is made by the birds themselves, one
after another confessing defeat until but one songster is left upon his
perch. The winner is quite exultant, while the others show as much
humiliation as a Chinaman who has "lost his face." The defeated
birds will not sing again for months.</p>

<p>In another article I have referred to the superstitions so widespread
in China. There is one form of superstition which has interfered
with both religion and commerce. The natives have for centuries
been the victims of sorcerers and fortune tellers who, professing
a knowledge of terrestrial and celestial forces, style themselves "Fungshui"
doctors and make a living by selecting lucky burial sites, foretelling
the future, etc. There are certain spirits which are supposed
to preside over certain places, and any change in the conformation
of the ground is thought to anger the spirits. A railroad cut or fill
is sometimes objected to for this reason, and a church spire is, in the
opinion of the superstitious, liable to endanger the peace and safety
of a community. However, commerce is extending in spite of the
"spirits" and the Christian religion is gradually making headway
against superstition.</p>

<p>At Pekin I attended a morning service at the Methodist church
where some six hundred Chinese men and women listened to a sermon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
in their own language delivered by an American missionary. On
Thanksgiving day we ate dinner at the Presbyterian Mission, and
during our travels through China met a number of ministers, physicians
and teachers. They all testified to the stimulus given to the
spread of religion by the fidelity shown by the Chinese Christians
during the Boxer troubles. At Nanking we visited a school conducted
by the Disciples or Christian Church, and at Shanghai, a school
supported by the Episcopalian Church of America. There is also at
Shanghai a college, the main purpose of which is to bring the white
and yellow races into closer harmony. Prof. Isaac T. Headland of
the Methodist University at Pekin has published a volume entitled
"Chinese Heroes," in which he gives a number of instances of consecrated
devotion on the part of the Chinese to the Christian faith,
and why should not China be a promising mission field? Buddhism
has here done its perfect work and can not reasonably ask for a
further trial; the philosophy of the sages has also been shown impotent
for the harmonious development of the three-fold man. China<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
has followed an ideal and followed it with a diligence rarely exhibited,
but that ideal has been weighed in the balance and found
wanting. It is often said in defense of Confucianism that its founder
gave to his disciples the golden rule, stated in its negative form, but
too little emphasis has been given to the difference between the doctrine
of Confucius, "Do not unto others as you would not have others
do unto you," and, the doctrine of the Nazarene, "Whatsoever ye would
that men should do to you, do ye even so to them." There is a world
of difference between negative harmlessness and positive helpfulness,
and Christianity could well afford to rest its case against Confucianism
on the comparison of these two doctrines.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="yuan" id="yuan"></a>
<img src="images/ill045.jpg" width="400" height="490" alt="yuan" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">YUAN SHI KAI&mdash;VICEROY TIENTSIN AND PEKIN</p></div>
</div>

<p>In the Analects of Confucius the philosopher is asked, "Is there one
word which may serve as a rule of practice for all one's life?" He
was answered, "Is not reciprocity such a word?" Here we have the
doctrine of selfishness as plausibly presented as it will ever be again.
Life is described as a balancing of favors&mdash;a nice calculation of good
done and good received. There is no suggestion here of a heart
overflowing with love, no intimation of a blessedness to be found in
giving.</p>

<p>At another time someone asked Confucius, "What do you say concerning
the principle that injury should be recompensed with kindness?"
He replied, "With what then will you recompense kindness?
Recompense injury with justice and recompense kindness with kindness."
In reply to another question, he goes so far as to charge that
one "who returns good for evil, is a man that is careful of his person."
How different these precepts are from those of the Sermon on the
Mount! Christians are accused of failure to live up to the high ideal
presented by Jesus, and the accusation is just, and yet, although the
Christian nations fall far short of the measure which they themselves
recognize, although professing Christians reflect but imperfectly the
rays which fall upon them from the Sun of Righteousness, they are
leading the world in all that is ennobling and uplifting, and China
gives silent recognition to the superiority of the western ideal in every
reform which she undertakes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3>EDUCATION, RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY.</h3>


<p>Chinese education has been very much overestimated. The literati
have boasted of the antiquity of the government and educational
system, the invention of the compass, the printing press and of gunpowder,
and the western world has been inclined to concede their
claims, but these claims will not bear investigation. The government
is ancient, but it is also antiquated. The emperor exercises a power
as unlimited as that of the czar and is as inaccessible to his subjects.
The ruling family seized the throne two and a half centuries ago and
has retained power because the people have learned to submit to
almost anything. The laws have not only been arbitrary, but they
have been cruel; the officials have not only been appointed without
consulting the governed, but they have been shamelessly corrupt.</p>

<p>When Confucius and Mencius taught, they complained of the degeneracy
of the government, and in more than twenty centuries that
have elapsed since those days, there has been no marked improvement.
Of course there have been pure and patriotic men in high
places occasionally, but the government showed neither perfection
then nor improvement afterwards&mdash;until within the last few years.</p>

<p>What if the compass was known to the Chinese before it was to
Europe? They made little use of it compared with the use to which
it was put by the Portuguese, the Spaniards, the Dutch and other
Europeans.</p>

<p>They invented gunpowder, and yet they equipped their soldiers
with bows and arrows down to the present generation.</p>

<p>They invented the printing press, and yet until recently they had
scarcely any newspapers and but few books. I shall speak in another
article of the improvement in this direction, but as an evidence of
the little use made of the printing press even now, I record the fact
that in a four days' ride (at present the train runs only in the daytime)
from the capital of the empire to Hankow, through a densely
populated section, we did not see a man reading a paper or hear the
voice of a newsboy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>Equally without justification is the boast of great learning among
the people. They have had no educational system and their children
have had to rely upon private schools, a few families getting together
and hiring a teacher. Even then the main purpose of their higher
education was to obtain a government position. As only a very limited
number could possibly be selected at the competitive examinations
held by the government, there was small incentive to study
and the written language, with two hundred and fourteen radicals
and twelve hundred different characters, was enough to discourage
even the ambitious. A Chinese official informed me that not more
than one man in a hundred could write a letter and that not more
than one in ten could understand a letter when read to him.</p>

<p>The object of the schools, such as they had, was to cultivate the
memory and to teach the pupils to write essays expounding the doctrines
of the Chinese sages. All of the schools used the same text
book, the primer in universal use having been prepared over eight
hundred years ago. Education was limited in the number who received
it and limited in the amount provided, and the course of
instruction was fossilized. None of the students were taught anything
about the outside world and but few of the people were students.
It is sufficient evidence of the absolute failure of their educational
system to compare this great empire, containing approximately one-fourth
of the population of the globe, with even the smaller states of
Europe in the production of scientists, scholars and poets. China has
had diplomats and astute statesmen, but these have been developed in
the school of experience rather than in halls of learning. Considering
the educational opportunities furnished, it is astonishing that she
has produced any great men at all.</p>

<p>China has her religions and they have doubtless exerted a moulding
influence upon the people, but the influence has not been an unmixed
good. Take, for instance, ancestor worship; it contains a
germ of good, in that it teaches respect and care for parents, but the
spirit has been lost in the observance of the letter until the welfare of
the living is neglected, that senseless sacrifices may be made to the
dead. At Canton we visited a place called "The Place of the Dead."
It is connected with a Buddhist temple and is just outside the city
wall. There are some four hundred rooms in the group of buildings
and nearly every room contains a coffin. Here the well-to-do deposit
the body of an ancestor and keep incense burning as long as
they can afford to pay for it. Rent must be paid for the rooms; the
light must be kept bright; food and drink must be offered to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
departed each day and the incense must be paid for. As someone
has remarked, it costs more to care for a dead ancestor than a live one.
We saw one coffin that had cost three thousand dollars; it had been
in the building for sixteen years and had been moved from one apartment
to another, a cheaper one being chosen each time as the resources
of the family declined. In some cases the families have become
so poor that they can neither pay rent nor buy a burying plot.</p>

<p>There is also at Canton an ancestral hall where for a specified sum
the name of an ancestor may be inscribed on a little wooden tablet;
incense is also burned here, too. Foreign residents relate instances
where servants have spent three years' income in burying a parent,
the money being borrowed and gradually repaid from the earnings.
Besides the first cost of burial, there must be frequent pilgrimages
to the grave. It is within the bounds of truth to say that the money
expended in elaborate funerals, in sacrifices to the dead, and in periodical
pilgrimages to tombs would have gone far toward educating and
enlightening each rising generation&mdash;and who will say that respect
for the dead can better be shown by formal ceremonies than by a
proper regard for the welfare of the descendants?</p>

<p>The tombs of the royal family are always objects of interest to
the tourist. The most famous of these tombs are north of Pekin and
so near to the great wall that they are usually visited at the same time,
three or four days being required for the trip. There are other
tombs of less renown still nearer to Pekin, while the tomb of the
first emperor of the Ming dynasty is just outside the walls of Nanking.
Some of these tombs are mere masses of masonry now, but all
were once richly carved. The avenues leading up to these tombs are
lined with large stone figures of men and animals. These are arranged
in pairs, one on each side of the road&mdash;two huge warriors, two priests,
two elephants standing, two elephants kneeling, two camels standing
and two kneeling, two horses standing and two kneeling, and lions,
bears and other animals in like positions. These figures are put near the
tomb that the ruler may be supplied with the things needful for his
happiness in the spirit world. And, speaking of tombs, the worship of
ancestors is destined to make China a vast graveyard, if, as now, graves
cannot be disturbed. It will be remembered that the Chinese government
cautioned the Russians and Japanese not to trespass upon the
graveyards at Mukden, where a number of Manchu emperors are
buried. The graves of the masses are as securely regarded, although distinguished
merely by a mound. In the neighborhood of the large cities
the cemeteries cover many square miles, and as they are constantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
added to and never diminished, they occupy an ever increasing area.
In the agricultural districts the burying grounds are scattered through
the fields, each family having its own plot. Sometimes when the
family has died out, the mound is neglected and the coffin is exposed.
At Shanghai and at Nanking we saw a number of coffins in the fields
which had never been covered.</p>

<p>The temples of China are interesting, but are generally in a state
of decay. The Confucian temple at Pekin is visited once a year
when sacrifices are made to China's supreme sage. The court of the
temple is filled with gnarled and knotted cedars of great age, in
which a colony of crows was chanting a requiem when we were there.
There are also in the court numerous tablets of marble, each resting
on the back of a stone turtle and bearing inscriptions; there are
other tablets bearing quotations from the writings of Confucius.</p>

<p>At Canton our guide took us to the temple of the five hundred gods.
They represent Buddhistic saints, are life size and each has an incense
urn before him. One of the gods has a very long arm, he being the
one who puts the moon up at nights; another represents a saint who
cut open his breast and exposed an image of Buddha to prove his
fidelity to the faith.</p>

<p>(Our guide at Canton was Ah Cum, who had conducted travelers
through the city for more than forty years and has brought up his
sons to the same profession. I mention his name for the benefit of
any readers of these lines who may chance to visit, as every tourist
should, this most Chinese of Chinese cities.)</p>

<p>There is in the vicinity of Pekin a temple with several thousand
images of Buddha, but they are small and made of clay, the original
bronze images having been carried away by the foreign troops during
the Boxer troubles.</p>

<p>Close to the walls of the city of Pekin stands what is called the
Yellow Temple, a rare work of art. The figures representing incidents
in the life of Buddha are very skillfully carved and one can not help
feeling indignation at the vandalism of the foreign soldiers who,
during the Boxer troubles, defaced this ancient monument. By far
the most impressive and elaborate religious structure in China is the
"Altar of Heaven," not far from the city of Pekin. It was built under
the Ming dynasty five hundred years ago and is still visited twice
each year by the emperor, who here offers sacrifices to heaven. The
sacrificial altar is built entirely of white marble. It is a triple circular
terrace, the base being a little more than two hundred feet in diameter,
the middle terrace one hundred and fifty feet and the top terrace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a><br /><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
nearly a hundred feet, each terrace being enclosed by a beautifully
carved balustrade. It stands about eighteen feet high, and the emperor
ascending to it alone, kneels at midnight and, as the representative
of the whole people, makes his offering to heaven. A bullock
without a blemish is used as the offering on these occasions. In architecture
the altar reminds one of the Greek structures, while some of
the features of the ceremony recall the rites of the Israelites as described
in the Old Testament.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><a name="altar" id="altar"></a>
<img src="images/ill046.jpg" width="600" height="343" alt="altar" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">ALTAR OF HEAVEN&mdash;PEKIN</p></div>
</div>

<p>Near to this altar is a pagoda, standing upon another triple, but
smaller, marble terrace; it is popularly known as the "Temple of
Heaven." Here on the first day of the Chinese year the emperor offers
his supplications to heaven for a blessing upon the year. This is the
most graceful and symmetrical pagoda in the empire, if not in the
Orient, and no one who visits the capital should fail to see it. Both
the altar and the temple are surrounded by a high wall, and the enclosed
court is shaded by veteran cedars.</p>

<p>While Buddhism has been regarded as the religion of China, Taoism
has also influenced the thought of the nation. It teaches the
existence of spirits but has degenerated into superstition and the
attempted conciliation of evil spirits. For instance, before each official
residence and before many private residences will be found a
wall, higher and wider than the front door, the purpose of which
is to keep out the evil spirits, which are supposed to travel only in
a straight line. When a building is to be made more than two stories
high, bunches of leaves are often tied to the top of the poles used for
scaffolding: this is done to deceive the evil spirits and make them
believe that it is a forest instead of a building, they being supposed
to be hostile to high buildings. After the roof is on, however, the
building is safe, but the ridge pole must curve up at the ends to keep
the spirits from descending. Boys are very much at a premium in
China, because the duty of guarding the graves devolves upon the
oldest son. If a man loses a boy or two, he sometimes dresses the
next boy like a girl in order to deceive the spirits, for a girl is, or at
least used to be, beneath the notice of even evil spirits. A very intelligent
Chinaman explained the disinclination of the ordinary Chinaman
to rescue a drowning man on the ground that if the evil spirits
were trying to drown the man, they would resent and punish any
attempt to save him.</p>

<p>But more potent than either Buddhism or Taoism has been the influence
of Confucius and his commentators. This great philosopher
was born 551 <small>B. C.</small>, and Mencius, his greatest disciple, nearly two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
hundred years later. The moral principles discussed by them were
not presented as original conceptions but rather urged as the principles
of previous emperors whose lives were regarded as ideal. In
another article, in the discussion of China's awakening, I shall speak
of the ethical teachings of Confucius, but it is worth while to note
at this time that his utterances with
regard to government fall far short
of the generally accepted doctrines of
to-day. While he insisted that rulers
owed certain duties to their subjects,
and were good or bad in proportion
as they set an example of virtue and
governed wisely, he did not intimate
that the people have either the right
to, or the capacity for, self-government.
His doctrines support the idea
that classes are necessary, the
"superior" people governing and
teaching, the rest doing the manual
labor.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 154px;"><a name="binding" id="binding"></a>
<img src="images/ill047.jpg" width="154" height="400" alt="binding" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">ILLUSTRATION OF FOOT BINDING.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Confucius taught that those who
were not in office need not concern
themselves about the administration
of the government&mdash;a doctrine
which paralyzed the patriotism of
the masses and invited abuses on the
part of the officials.</p>

<p>The system by which officials were
chosen was also calculated to breed
selfishness and indifference to the
public weal, as well as to impede
progress. The course of instruction,
as before stated, contemplated merely
the memorizing of the Chinese
classics composed of the sayings of
the sages, poetry and Chinese history.</p>

<p>The aspirants for honors were not required to think for themselves,
to understand the problems of their generation or to know anything of
the science of government. To compose a good essay upon what Confucius
said, upon what Mencius thought, or upon what Shun or Wan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
or Woo did was sufficient. This naturally chained each generation to
the past and locked the door to advancement.</p>

<p>The successful candidate felt that his appointment was due to his
own merit and that he was under no obligation to anyone except the
members of his family who had furnished the money necessary to
enable him to take the various examinations. Neither the securing
of the office nor the retaining of it rested upon his ability to devise
wise policies or upon his interest in the people at large. The emperor
with unlimited power was above him, and the people with unlimited
patience were below him.</p>

<p>In later years the examinations have sometimes become a farce, and
rank has been offered to the highest bidder, bidding being encouraged
by an intimation that this might be the last chance. But even when
honestly conducted, the civil service system of China was not calculated
to develop the official or to secure a good, wise and progressive
government.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3>CHINA'S AWAKENING.</h3>


<p>In what I have said of the Chinese government, system of education,
religion and superstitions, I have referred to the nation as it has been
for some twenty centuries&mdash;chained to tradition, stagnant, asleep. Society
was stratified; those in power seemed to have no higher aspiration
than to live upon the labor of the masses, and the masses seemed
to entertain no thought of emancipation. The life of the people was
occupied with ceremony, but there was no genuine fellowship or sympathetic
connection between them, outside of the family tie, and even
the family was likely to be a storm center because of the conflicting
interests collected under one roof. Education was monopolized by a
comparatively few, and there was no breadth to such instruction as was
given. Superstition took the place of religion and the placating of the
spirits of the deceased outweighed the nurture and development of those
still on earth.</p>

<p>But a change is taking place in China such as has revolutionized
Japan within the last half century. The sleeping giantess, whose
drowsy eyes have so long been shut to the rays of the morning sun,
is showing unmistakable signs of an awakening. There was a vitality
among her people which even two thousand years of political apathy
could not exhaust&mdash;a sturdiness which centuries of poverty and superstition
could not entirely destroy. Increasing contact with Europe
and America is having its influence, and the example of Japan is even
more potent, for the people of Japan are not only neighbors, but are
more like them in color and race characteristics. Let me note some
of the evidences of this change.</p>

<p>The government, so long an absolute despotism, is about to become
a constitutional monarchy. In 1898 the emperor, under the influence
of some radical reformers, prepared a program almost revolutionary in
its character. Recognizing that his aunt, the dowager empress, would
oppose him, he prepared to put her under guard while the change was
being made, but the old lady, learning of his plan, promptly took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
him in hand and made him a prisoner in his own palace. Since that
time she has been the unquestioned ruler of the empire, the nominal
emperor affixing his signature to the papers which she prepares. But
so rapidly has the situation developed that she is now instituting the
very reforms for the suggestion of which she so recently imprisoned
her nephew. A commission of prominent officials is now abroad, some
in Europe, some in America, studying the constitutions and governmental
institutions of other countries. What a concession, when we
remember the self-sufficiency of China, the characterization of surrounding
nations as "rude tribes" and the use of the term "barbarians"
to designate even those with whom she made treaties!</p>

<p>It is reported that the dowager-empress recently called her councilors
together and asked how long it would take to establish a constitutional
government. When told that it would probably require twelve or fifteen
years, she replied that it must be done sooner than that as she
could not hope to live much longer, and wanted it in operation before
she died. Whether she appreciates the full importance of the change
may be doubted, but the fact that the great nations, with the exception
of Russia, have constitutions, has doubtless made its impression upon
her; and Russia's defeat at the hands of the Japanese, coupled with
present internal disturbances in the czar's domain, contains its lesson.</p>

<p>As early as 1901, a commission was appointed to examine and report
on all proposed measures affecting the organization and administration
of the government, and in 1904 a general assembly of the
ministers of the principal boards was provided for. While these newly
created bodies have no legislative power, they indicate the trend
toward a more popular government. The constitution, when adopted,
as it ultimately will be, will inaugurate a parliamentary system. There
is, therefore, a distinct advance along governmental lines, and this in
itself means much for China and for the outside world.</p>

<p>The criminal code is also being revised. The Hon. Wu Ting Fang,
former minister to the United States and now vice-president of the
board of foreign affairs, has been made a member of the board of
punishments. He and Shen Chia Pen, the vice-president of the board
of punishments, have by imperial decree been intrusted with the revision
and codifying of the laws of China. They have established a
bureau with a staff of secretaries and translators and have spent two
years in the examination of the civil and criminal codes of the different
countries in order to select laws which are applicable to the
conditions existing in China. Ex-Minister Wu has taken a deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a><br /><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
interest in this subject and kindly furnished me with the following
list of reforms to which the imperial sanction has been secured:</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 381px;"><a name="viceroy" id="viceroy"></a>
<img src="images/ill049.jpg" width="381" height="600" alt="viceroy" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">VICEROY CHANG CHIH TUNG</p></div>
</div>

<p>1. Ling Chi, slow death by slicing to pieces, has been abolished.
It was the punishment formerly prescribed for one found guilty of
paricide, high treason, wilful murder of husband (the murder of husband
by wife was according to Chinese law a much graver offense than
the murder of wife by husband).</p>

<p>2. The heads of criminals were formerly exposed to the public after
execution. This has also been abolished.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="fang" id="fang"></a>
<img src="images/ill050.jpg" width="400" height="503" alt="fang" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">WU TING FANG.</p></div>
</div>

<p>3. The beheading of a corpse of a criminal who died before execution
is no longer permitted.</p>

<p>4. According to the old law, parents, relatives and friends of one
convicted of serious crimes were subject to punishment; now the punishment
is confined to the guilty party. (While the practice of including
innocent relatives in the sentence seems barbarous in the extreme,
it was, after all, not so different in principle from the practice of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
western nations which in times of war inflict punishment indiscriminately
upon innocent and guilty alike.)</p>

<p>5. The branding of criminals has been abandoned.</p>

<p>6. Corporal punishment of criminals is also abolished.</p>

<p>7. The torturing of accused persons during trial, except where the
accused is charged with murder, and where the evidence of guilt is
clear, has also been abolished. According to the Chinese law a person
convicted of murder cannot be put to death until he confesses, and torture
has been retained in a case of this kind as a means of compelling
confession when the guilt has been otherwise established, but Mr. Wu
expresses the hope that torture in such cases will be abolished in the
near future.</p>

<p>The revision commission has also succeeded in obtaining an imperial
decree ordering the construction of more modern prisons, requiring the
inspection of prisoners and compelling humane treatment. Formerly
relief from cruel treatment could only be secured by paying the official
in charge.</p>

<p>The commission is now working upon a code of procedure and intends
among other things the recommendation of a system of trial
by jury, the admission of lawyers to practice in the courts and the
relieving of prisoners and witnesses from the humiliating practice of
kneeling in court.</p>

<p>In order to secure competent judges and lawyers for the carrying
out of the new code, the commission has obtained the sanction of the
government for the establishment of a law school at Pekin (the site has
already been purchased), and the high schools and colleges of the
various provinces have been instructed to add law to the curriculum
of their studies.</p>

<p>Minister Wu called attention to other reforms which have been
introduced into China within the last few years, among which may be
mentioned the construction of railways, the establishment of a government
board of commerce, the formation of a police force, municipal
and provincial, the promulgation of incorporation laws and the establishment
of mints.</p>

<p>At first the railroads were built by concessions issued to foreign companies,
but because of the constant difficulties which grew out of such
concessions, there is a growing sentiment in favor of government railroads.
It was in the pursuance of this policy that the government
acquired the rights of the American company which was projecting
a road from Hankow to Canton. Some of the Americans residing in
China have expressed regret that this road should have passed out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
American hands, but I am satisfied that it is better for the United
States that China should own the road than that it should be
in the hands of foreigners or even in the hands of Americans.
It would be impossible to operate the road without more or less friction,
which would involve the countries in diplomatic controversies. If
China operates the road herself, we will have equal rights with foreigners
without the risks involved in private ownership. And, speaking
of roads, the city of Pekin is passing through an era of street
improvement. Some eleven miles of pavement have been laid within
three years, and concrete sidewalks are making their appearance.</p>

<p>The finances of China have been in a miserable condition. Cash is
the money in common use, and these brass coins, running about one
thousand to the dollar, are too heavy for any excepting the smallest
transactions. Think of doing business with money so heavy that you
must carry a hundred pounds of money to make a ten dollar purchase.
Some complained of silver in the United States because of its weight,
but the silver certificates completely answered this argument, for a
silver certificate is as convenient as a gold certificate and more convenient
than gold coin; but in China paper money is not used among the
masses. The monetary unit is called a tael and, if coined, would
weigh about one and one-third times the Mexican dollar, but no
coins of this denomination are in circulation. The Mexican dollar is
in common use, and in some of the provinces there are fractional
silver coins. But the Mexican dollar is so often counterfeited that it
is customary to test each coin as it passes from hand to hand. I
secured one of the "three piece dollars," as they are called. These
are made by sawing a thin disc from each side of the dollar; the
silver is then removed from the center and the cavity filled with lead
and the two faces soldered on. The work is done so skillfully that
the counterfeit can only be detected by the ring. Several of the banks
issue paper notes payable in Mexican dollars, but they are discounted
in the various cities so that a traveler's currency is always undergoing
a shave. The government has decided to establish a uniform system
of currency consisting of gold, silver and copper, the silver tael to
remain the unit.</p>

<p>Patent laws and trade mark laws are now being prepared; in fact,
China is being quickened in many ways by the increasing knowledge
which she is acquiring. They are even considering a change in the
alphabet and characters in order that the language may be more easily
learned.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><a name="cart" id="cart"></a>
<img src="images/ill051.jpg" width="600" height="349" alt="cart" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">CHINESE CART AT PEKIN</p></div>
</div>

<p>I have already referred to the fact that China has until recently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a><br /><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
been practically without newspapers. There is no better evidence of
the progress which China is making than is to be found in the increase
in the number of her newspapers. While the circulation of these
papers is small as compared with the circulation of similar papers in
the United States and Japan, still the growth is constant and the
colloquial dialect sometimes employed brings the news and editorial
pages within the comprehension of those who cannot read books. Many
of these newspapers are published in the interest of reforms. One
of the papers started at Hong Kong opposed the examination system
by which civil officials were selected, the foot-binding custom and the
habit of wearing the queue. The
editor cut off his own queue as
an example and is now encouraged
by the fact that the soldiers
are gradually adopting a like
course. He is able to note progress
in the matter of foot-binding. An
imperial edict has been issued exhorting
the people to abandon
the practice, and numerous societies
are engaged in spreading
literature upon this subject.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 300px;"><a name="nanking" id="nanking"></a>
<img src="images/ill052.jpg" width="300" height="419" alt="nanking" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">CHOU FU, VICEROY OF NANKING.</p></div>
</div>

<p>But more important still is the
recent abolition of the examinations.
This is a revolution which
has shaken the ancient empire
to its foundation, for the examination
system not only affected
the government but moulded the
educational system as well. In
the larger cities elaborate provisions
were made for these examinations,
in some places from ten to fifteen thousand stalls being
constructed. These stalls are about three feet by six deep, and high
enough to permit the student to stand erect. The only furniture was a
board for a seat and another for a desk. At a given hour the students
entered these stalls and were given their themes; they were then kept
in their stalls without communication until their tasks were finished.
Now the stalls stand idle and the officials are chosen from the graduates
of the newly established schools.</p>

<p>We visited the examination stalls at Pekin and found them in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
ruins. They had been occupied by the Boxers in 1900, who tore out
the rafters and used them for fuel. After the roofs fell in the unprotected
walls rapidly crumbled.</p>

<p>The conservatives have been very much incensed by the abandonment
of the examinations, but the reformers regard it as a long step
in the right direction.</p>

<p>On every hand one sees signs of intellectual development. As
stated in another article, the private school was for centuries the only
source from which instruction in books could be gained. Now a
complete system of schools is being established, consisting of primary,
middle and high schools, with colleges in the larger cities. Viceroy
Yuan Shih Kai, who presides over the district in which Pekin is
situated, and whom, through the courtesy of Minister Rockhill, I had
an opportunity to meet, informed me that he had established four
thousand schools within his jurisdiction within the past five years.
The viceroy is the successor of Li Hung Chang and is considered the
most influential man in the empire. He is about forty-six years old
and impresses one as a man of great mental ability and alertness. He
seems to take a deep interest in the reforms now being worked out,
and is cordial in his treatment of Americans.</p>

<p>Consul General Rodgers, of Shanghai, happened to be in Nanking
during our visit there, and we paid our respects to Viceroy Chou Fu.
This viceroy is quite old and feeble but he is grappling with the
new problems and is a patron of education. He has established one
thousand schools during the last few years, and estimated the number
of Chinese students in Japan at this time at five thousand.</p>

<p>At Shanghai there is a government university, the buildings of
which cost two hundred and ten thousand dollars. We learned that
in some places Buddhist temples are being converted into schools and
that girls' schools are already being provided for. This is even a
greater evidence of progress than the opening of schools for boys,
because of the inferior position which woman has occupied in the
celestial empire.</p>

<p>Besides the government schools there are numerous missionary
schools in which instruction is given to both boys and girls. We
visited some of these schools at Pekin, Nanking and Shanghai, and
found the instructors encouraged by the attendance and the interest
taken. A number of Americans, and a still larger number of Japanese,
are teaching in the government schools.</p>

<p>But enough has been said to indicate the regeneration through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
which the Flowery Kingdom is passing. What will be the effect of
the change upon the world? Who is wise enough to peer into the
future and outline the record of the next century? Japan furnishes
the nearest parallel. Compare the Japan of fifty years ago with the
Japan of to-day and some conception can be formed of China fifty
years hence. As Japan's commerce increased, so is China's commerce
increasing; as Japan sent statesmen abroad to investigate the methods
of other governments, so China is now sending inquirers abroad; as
Japan turned her attention to schools and colleges, so China is learning
the advantage of universal education; as Japanese students journeyed
into distant lands in search of knowledge, so Chinese students
are in increasing numbers studying in foreign colleges. Even in the
enlargement and training of her army she is patterning after Japan
and employing Japanese drill masters.</p>

<p>It need not be thought strange that there is an anti-foreign sentiment
in China. Was there not an anti-foreign sentiment in Japan
forty years ago? The Shimonoseki affair was not unlike the Boxer
trouble, except that it was less fatal to life, but it exerted a large
influence in the overthrow of the shogun and in the restoration of
the emperor. Just as in Japan the old finally gave way to the new,
and progress took the place of stagnation, so in China the old must
give way to the new.</p>

<p>Advance is inevitable and the world need not fear the result. If
China were strong enough to give effect to the hostility which some
of her people now feel, she might be a menace to the peace of the
world, but she cannot grow in strength faster than she grows in
knowledge, and as she grows in knowledge she will learn, as other
nations have learned, that nations help rather than injure each other
by the material, intellectual and moral development of their people.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<h3>CHINESE EXCLUSION<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></h3>

<p>If every American could visit China, the question of Chinese immigration
would soon be settled upon a permanent basis, for no one can
become acquainted with the Chinese coolie without recognizing the
impossibility of opening the doors of our country to him without
injustice to our own laboring men, demoralization to our social ideas,
injury to China's reputation among us and danger to our diplomatic
relations with that country.</p>

<p>I made it a point to inquire among the Chinese whom I met, in
order to ascertain the real sentiment back of the boycott. I had heard
of students being subjected to harsh regulations at ports of entry, of
travelers humiliated by confinement in uncomfortable sheds and of
merchants treated rudely, and I supposed that these things had
aroused the resentment. I found, however, that the things complained
of were more difficult to deal with and the concessions demanded
impossible to grant.</p>

<p>In order to understand the boycott one must know something of
Chinese history. As China has never had representative government,
the people have been compelled to bring their complaints before
officials by petition, and where the petition has been ignored, they
have been accustomed to bring such pressure to bear as was within
their power, and the boycott has often been resorted to as a means
of compelling action upon the part of officials. They, therefore,
conceived the idea of a boycott against American goods for the double
purpose of urging their own government to favorable action and of
calling the attention of the American government to their complaint.
Our officials are doing what they can to convince the Chinese government
of the injustice and folly of the boycott, and the Chinese
officials with whom I conversed seemed anxious to co-operate with
our minister and consuls. Immediate action upon the part of our
congress, whether favorable or unfavorable to the Chinese, will remove
the excuse for a boycott and our government should not be influenced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
in its action by any threats affecting trade, for the subject is too grave
a one to be determined by commercial considerations.</p>

<p>The Americans who are doing business in China are naturally
anxious to cultivate friendly relations with the Chinese merchants,
and just before we reached Hong Kong the American business men
residing there cabled home a statement of the minimum changes in
the exclusion act asked for by the Chinese merchants. I had the
privilege of attending a dinner at which a number of the leading
Chinese merchants of Hong Kong presented their views, and it may
be worth while to give here an abstract of their demands as drawn
out by cross-examination.</p>

<p>They desire&mdash;First, that the word laborer shall be clearly and distinctly
defined, "according to the highest standard English and be
limited to such class or classes of persons as originally intended to be
designated by both governments."</p>

<p>Second, that all regulations and legislative measures affecting Chinese
immigration shall be communicated to and approved by the
Chinese government before going into force, and that when in force,
they should not be altered without consent of the Chinese government.</p>

<p>Third, that American consuls stationed in China shall have full
power to grant certificates of admission to persons not included in the
prohibited classes, such certificates to be conclusive except in cases
of actual fraud.</p>

<p>Fourth, that the American consul in China shall without delay
issue certificates of admission to such Chinese not included in the
prohibited classes as shall obtain passports from the Chinese government.</p>

<p>Fifth, that the Chinese government shall be permitted to appoint
one European medical practitioner to act in conjunction with a medical
officer appointed by the United States at the port of departure
and that no one shall be rejected as diseased unless certified to be so
by both medical officers.</p>

<p>Sixth, that Chinese once admitted into the United States shall enjoy
the same rights and protection accorded to the subjects of the most
favored nation, and in case of ill treatment shall be entitled to damages
from the government.</p>

<p>Seventh, that Chinese passing through the United States en route
for another country shall enjoy the same privileges as the subjects
of the most favored nations.</p>

<p>Eighth, that Chinese residing in the United States shall not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a><br /><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
required to register unless such registration is required of the subjects
of the most favored nation.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><a name="manchu" id="manchu"></a>
<img src="images/ill054.jpg" width="600" height="347" alt="manchu" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">MANCHU AND CHINESE WOMEN&mdash;CHINA</p></div>
</div>

<p>Ninth, that Chinese laborers shall be admitted into the Hawaiian
and the Philippine Islands, provided that the legislatures or local
authorities of such islands are willing. (While this proviso is satisfactory
to the Hong Kong merchants, it seems to have been objected
to by the Chinese of Amoy and Canton.)</p>

<p>Tenth, that any Chinese detained at an American port of entry
for purposes of inquiry shall be permitted to engage legal assistance
and furnish bond for appearance; should the decision be unfavorable,
he shall have the right to appeal to the highest court of justice, and
in case of any technical or formal error in his passport or certificate,
he shall be allowed to correct the same without undergoing deportation.</p>

<p>Eleventh, that any Chinese residing in the United States shall have
the right to bring his parents, wife, family and minor brothers and
sisters to reside with him.</p>

<p>Twelfth, that Chinese lawfully admitted to the United States but
deported because of failure to register shall be readmitted on
satisfactory proof of possessing in the United States property or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bona
fide</i> debt up to the required amount.</p>

<p>The second demand could not be complied with, without putting
the enforcement of the exclusion act so largely in the hands of the
Chinese government as to very much cripple it.</p>

<p>The third demand is reasonable. Our country ought to be bound
by the act of its own consuls, except in case of fraud, and those who
are to be excluded ought to be notified before incurring the expense
of a trip across the ocean.</p>

<p>The fourth demand should not be complied with unless the
Chinese government assumes pecuniary responsibility for any errors
in the issuing of the passport and for the subject's compliance with
the regulations provided by our government.</p>

<p>The fifth demand is absurd, because it virtually transfers to a
European physician appointed by the Chinese government the power
to decide on the health of the immigrant. While, according to the
language of the demand, the Chinese appointee would act in conjunction
with an American physician, a favorable report by the
Chinese appointee would admit the immigrant in spite of an adverse
report by the physician appointed by our government. It is perfectly
proper that a physician appointed by the Chinese government should
be permitted to be present at the examination, and it is only fair
that the examination should be made at the port of departure, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
it is necessary that the examination should be in the hands of physicians
appointed, and removable, by our government.</p>

<p>The tenth demand is for the most part reasonable. A Chinaman
detained for purposes of inquiry should be allowed to secure counsel
and furnish bond, and if the error in his certificate is technical or
formal, he should be allowed to correct it on such terms as are equitable,
but it would hardly be wise to permit appeal to the supreme court
unless some vital principle is involved.</p>

<p>Demands six, seven and eight are based upon the theory that
Chinese in the United States should be treated in every respect like
subjects of other nations, and this overlooks two material facts: First,
that certain classes of Chinese are prohibited from coming to the
United States; and, second, that the Chinese who do come to the
United States come for reasons different from those which influence
immigrants from Europe. (I shall consider the second reason later.)
The fact that some Chinese are excluded while others are
admitted makes it necessary to enforce rules against the Chinese
that are necessary against immigrants from other nations.
While no humiliating conditions ought to be imposed, still our
country is justified in enforcing such rules and regulations as will
prevent fraud and evasion. This cannot be considered an act of unfriendliness
because our nation adopts the same principle in dealing
with its own people. For instance, the voters in the cities are required
to register from time to time, often at great inconvenience, while
registration is not required in rural districts, the discrimination being
regarded as necessary to prevent election frauds in the cities. In like
manner, Chinese may be required to register, even though registration
may be inconvenient, if experience shows registration to be necessary
to prevent evasion of the immigration law.</p>

<p>In the case of travelers it ought to be possible to provide for such
a certification of passports as to relieve Chinese tourists, whether passing
through, or visiting in, the United States from annoyance or
vexation. It goes without saying that they should be protected as
completely as tourists coming from any other country. Every encouragement
should be given to travel between countries, for an exchange
of views and ideas between nations is as wholesome and as necessary to
progress as social intercourse between individuals.</p>

<p>The ninth demand, while strenuously insisted upon by the Chinese,
involves questions of the first magnitude. It is a question whether
Chinese could be admitted into Hawaii and then excluded from other
states and territories, and in the case of the Philippines, our country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
should be slow to establish a policy there before the length of our
occupation is determined.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that the purpose of the first, eleventh and twelfth
demands is to increase the number of Chinese in the United States.
The eleventh contemplates the indefinite enlargement of the family
of each resident by the addition of first, one wife; second (possibly),
two parents, not to speak of an uncertain number of children, brothers
and sisters. While to the Chinese who are accustomed to the
patriarchal system, the admission of parents, brothers and sisters would
seem a very natural demand, it would hardly seem reasonable to
Americans unless it was limited to the classes excepted from the exclusion
act.</p>

<p>The real interest, however, centers in the first demand, viz., that
the definition of the term laborer shall be enlarged. I questioned
several of the Hong Kong merchants in regard to the matter, and
found that they desired especially the admission of clerks and skilled
laborers. They contended that a Chinese merchant could not conduct
a store in the United States without Chinese help and that to exclude
clerks was virtually to exclude merchants. When questioned as to
the number of clerks needed, they estimated that there were about
four thousand merchants in the United States and that each merchant
would need from six to ten clerks. When surprise was expressed at
the number, it was explained that some had to cook and do housework.
It was even argued that Chinese shoemakers and tailors were also
necessary to provide clothing and footwear for the Chinese residing
in the United States. There was a division of opinion as to whether
laundry men should be classed as merchants and entitled to clerks.
But excluding laundry men and counting eight clerks to the store,
this one change in definition would open the door to about thirty-two
thousand, almost a fifty per cent increase, according to the estimate
made by the Hong Kong merchants, of seventy thousand Chinese
now in the United States. Whether the admission of clerks could be
so regulated and restricted as to make it possible to grant this demand
in whole or in part is a question which I am not prepared to answer
without further information as to the location of the merchants, the
character of their business and the sentiment of the local community.</p>

<p>The admission of skilled laborers is one upon which it is easier
to form an opinion. The Chinese are not only an industrious people,
but they are capable of becoming skilled artisans. They could supply
every factory in the United States with skilled workmen and still
have millions to spare. Nearly all the reasons which apply to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a><br /><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
exclusion of the coolie, apply to the skilled laborer, and they can,
therefore, be considered together.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><a name="wheelbarrow" id="wheelbarrow"></a>
<img src="images/ill055.jpg" width="600" height="354" alt="wheelbarrow" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE CHINESE WHEELBARROW</p></div>
</div>

<p>It developed during the dinner that while the demands expressly
recognized the improbability of coolies being admitted, most of the
Chinese present favored the entire repeal of the restriction law. They
resented any discrimination against their people as unfriendly and
unwarranted. One Chinaman of prominence, in another city, went
so far as to intimate that such discrimination would not be permitted
if China had a large army and navy and was able to enforce her
rights.</p>

<p>As the whole question turns on the admission of the Chinese laborer,
let us consider, first, the difference between the European immigrant
and the Chinese immigrant and, second, the general objections to
the admission of Chinese workmen.</p>

<p>The Chinaman, unlike the European, regards America as only temporarily
his home, preserves his national customs and peculiarities
and finally returns, carrying his savings with him. He is not attracted
by our institutions and brings with him no love of American ideals.
To him the United States is a field to be exploited and nothing more.
The European casts in his lot with us, mingles with the population
and in a few generations his identity is lost in our composite race. He
has neither peculiarities of thought or dress to distinguish him from
those among whom he labors, and his children are soon an indistinguishable
part of the community. Not so with the Chinese. They
are not only distinguished by their dress, language and habits, but
they remain entirely separate and apart from those among whom they
dwell. This difference is not only due to the wide dissimilarity in
history, tradition and habit, but also to the absence of any permanent
or patriotic interest in the land in which they sojourn.</p>

<p>The plane of living and the rate of wages are surprisingly low in
China. When we were crossing the Yellow River I noticed a number
of coolies unloading stone and inquired their wages. They received
one hundred and fifty cash, or about seven and a half cents gold, per
day. When this compensation is compared with the wages paid in
the United States for the same kind of labor, it is easy to understand
why Chinese laborers are drawn to our country. In discussing the
immigration question with a Chinese official, I asked him what he paid
his coachman. He replied that the head coachman received what was
equivalent to $10 in gold per month, while the subordinates received
from $3.50 to $5. Out of these wages they must pay for their own
food. There is considerable difference in the efficiency of labor, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
making due allowance for that, the Chinaman could in some occupations
make twice as much in America as at home and yet work for
half what Americans receive.</p>

<p>Long experience has taught the Chinaman to economize until he
has reduced living to the minimum. Our guide in one city fixed $1
(50 cents gold) as the weekly cost of living for one person, but many
live upon less. In traveling from Pekin to Hankow we were compelled
to provide our own meals, and the very competent cook whom
we secured was regularly receiving $1 a week in gold.</p>

<p>A ride through the streets of a Chinese city furnishes ample evidence
of the economy of the people. The small measures used, the tiny
piles of edibles exposed for sale, the little bundles carried from the
market&mdash;these explain why cash, running about ten to a cent, can be
used as currency. Oranges are often sold without the peeling, the
peeling being sold separately, and peanuts seem to be counted instead
of measured. At Canton we saw one man trudging home from market
with a satisfied air, carrying two pig tails tied together with a piece of
grass. The well-to-do have many delicacies, like birds' nest soup and
shark fins, some of which we tasted at the luncheon given by the viceroy
at Nanking and at the Hong Kong dinner; and among those who can
afford it, elaborate dinners are quite common, but among the masses
the food is of the cheapest and coarsest kind.</p>

<p>In the matter of fuel the same scrupulous economy is exercised.
Every dead leaf and twig is scraped from the ground and even the
weeds are condemned to fiery punishment for presuming to grow
upon such precious soil.</p>

<p>It would require generations to bring our people down to a plane
upon which they could compete with the Chinese, and this would
involve a large impairment in the efficiency in their work.</p>

<p>It is not just to the laboring men of the United States that they
should be compelled to labor upon the basis of Chinese coolie labor
or stand idle and allow their places to be filled by an alien race with
no thought of permanent identification with our country. The
American laborer not only produces the wealth of our nation in
time of peace, but he is its sure defender in time of war. Who will
say that his welfare and the welfare of his family shall be subordinated
to the interests of those who abide with us but for a time,
who, while with us, are exempt from draft or military burden, and
who, on their return, drain our country of its currency? A foreign
landlord system is almost universally recognized as a curse to a nation,
because the rent money is sent out of the country; Chinese immigration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
on a large scale would give us the evil effects of foreign landlordism
in addition to its other objectionable features.</p>

<p>When I pointed out the fact that Chinese did not, like other
immigrants, contemplate permanent residence in the United States,
a Chinese official replied that they would become citizens if the law
permitted it, and to the objection that they would even then remain
distinct from the rest of the people, he answered by advancing arguments
in favor of amalgamation. He claimed that the descendants
(called Eurasians) of Chinese who had intermarried with Europeans
were brighter than the average children of either race. I did not
have an opportunity to test the accuracy of these conclusions, but it
is evident that amalgamation has not been carried on to any great
extent either in China or in the countries to which the Chinamen have
gone. The instances of intermarriage are so rare that they do not
affect the general problem.</p>

<p>The fact that the Chinese do now, and would probably if admitted
to citizenship, form an unassimilated, if not an indigestible, element,
separated from the remainder of our population by a race line, raises
another objection to their admission as laborers. They make good
servants, learning quickly and obeying conscientiously. Americans
who have employed them testify to their trustworthiness and industry.
If they were permitted to freely enter the United States, it
is likely that they would soon solve the domestic labor problem, of
which we hear so much, for as cooks, waiters and house boys they are
an unqualified success. But what would be the effect upon our
civilization of such a stratification of society? At present we have
no racial distinction between employer and employé (except that
presented by the negro problem), and one race problem is enough.
If we were to admit Chinese coolies, we would find it more and more
difficult to induce white people to enter into competition with them
and manual labor would bear an odium which ought not to be placed
upon it. We need to teach the dignity of labor and to lessen the
aversion to it; a coolie class would make it difficult, if not impossible,
to make progress in the work of cementing our society into one
harmonious whole. If American ideals are to be realized there must
be no barrier between the rich and the poor, no obstacles in the way
of advancement from manual labor to intellectual work. China has
suffered immeasurably because of the complete separation of her
educated classes from her laborers.</p>

<p>A sentimental argument is sometimes advanced to the effect that
we have no moral right to exclude any who seek to come among us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a><br /><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Whether this argument has any force depends, first, on the purpose
of the immigrant, and second, upon our power to assimilate. If
his coming is purely commercial and he has no ambition to improve
us by his coming or to profit morally and intellectually by contact
with us, he cannot demand admission upon moral or sentimental
ground. And even if his paramount reason for coming were a desire
to learn of us, it would still be necessary to consider how far we
could go in helping him without injury to ourselves. While visiting
the sick is most meritorious, one who gave all his time to such work,
leaving no time for sleep, would soon be a physical wreck; feeding
the hungry is most commendable, but one who gave away all of his
substance, reserving nothing for his own nourishment, could not long
serve his fellows. In like manner, our own power to help the world
by the absorption of surplus population has certain natural and necessary
limitations. We have a mission to fulfill and we cannot excuse
ourselves if we cripple our energies in a mistaken effort to carry a
burden heavier than our strength can support.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">FASHIONABLE CONVEYANCE AT HONG KONG</p></div>
</div>

<p>Students ought to be invited to our country; we can afford to make
the welcome cordial and access to our institutions easy, for there is
no better way of influencing other countries for good than through
their young men and young women who, gathering new ideas in
America, carry them back and apply them in their own country.
A small part of the money now spent in building warships to protect
us from imaginary foes would, if spent in the education of the children
of foreigners, make us friends abroad who would constantly
lessen the probability of war. The newspapers have given currency
to the report that our government contemplates returning to China
a part of the indemnity exacted because of the Boxer attack, and the
Chinese are much gratified at the rumor. It is coupled with the
statement that the return of the money would be conditioned upon
the expenditure of the money for education. I can conceive of no
greater favor that our country can bestow upon China than to make
permanent provision for schools which will give the Chinese youth an
opportunity to acquire the most modern instruction in literature and
in physical and political science. If the sum to be returned were
divided and the larger part given for the endowment of a series of
universities in China, while the smaller part endowed a college at
Washington, under the control of the Chinese embassy, it would do
more to extend our commerce, our ideals and our prestige than a
hundred times that sum expended on a military establishment or
a navy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>There is one argument against the admission of coolies which ought
to commend itself to the Chinese as well as to the Americans, viz.,
that the standing of China among us is prejudiced by the fact that
she is judged by her lowest and most ignorant classes. There has
always been an educated class in China, and while the number belonging
to it has been limited and the scope of education narrow as
compared with the scope of education in the western world, still
there have been culture and refinement. Artists have appeared from
time to time, as well as artisans skilled in porcelain, metal working,
carving, decoration, etc. There have been merchants of standing and
integrity (in fact, integrity is the rule among Chinese merchants.)
If China could be known by these or even by the averaging of her
superior and inferior classes, she would stand higher among the
nations. But she is known now, except in diplomatic circles, by the
coolies who are carried by contractors from one place to another until
local sentiment leads to their exclusion. And, I may add, that it
has led to their exclusion from Australia and that the question of
exclusion from the Transvaal has been discussed in the English parliament.</p>

<p>This argument received respectful attention when presented to some
of the prominent Chinese, for they recognize the injury which has
been done to the nation's reputation by having the Chinese people
known by their worst representatives.</p>

<p>There is a fourth argument, the force of which was admitted at
the Hong Kong dinner by the merchants who had resided in the
United States, viz., that the admission of coolies (and it would apply
to skilled mechanics also) would involve the nations in constant diplomatic
controversy over race conflicts. If it is human for Chinese
to desire to improve their condition by immigration to the United
States, it is also human for American laborers to resent enforced
idleness when presented as an alternative to a lower scale of living.
With any large increase in the number of Chinese laborers in the United
States, it would be necessary to incur the expense of an increased army
and police force to preserve order, and even then it would be difficult
to prevent occasional violence, and violence in the United States would
lead to retaliation upon Americans residing in China. These race
riots in our country and in China would not only strain the relations
between the nations but would nullify our attempt to create a favorable
impression upon Chinese students and embarrass the work of
our missionaries in China.</p>

</div>

<p>It is better to be frank and candid with the Chinese government.
There are twenty times as many Chinese in America as there are
Americans in China, and we give to China as much in trade advantage
as we receive from her, not to speak of the money which Americans
voluntarily contribute to extend education and religion in the
Celestial empire. China has no reason to complain, for we have
been generous in dealing with her. We can still be not only just, but
generous, but it would be neither kindness to her nor fairness to our
own people to invite an immigration of such a character as to menace
our own producers of wealth, endanger our social system and disturb
the cordial friendship and good will between America and China.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<h3>THE PHILIPPINES&mdash;NORTHERN ISLANDS AND
THEIR PEOPLE.</h3>


<p>While a deep interest in the political problems tempts me to deal
at once with the policy to be pursued by our government
with respect to the Filipinos, I am constrained to proceed
logically and discuss first the islands and their people. And in speaking
of the Filipinos, a distinction should be made between those who
inhabit the northern islands and are members of one branch of the
Christian Church and those who inhabit the island of Mindanao and
the Sulu Archipelago&mdash;people who are followers of Mohammed.
While a considerable number of Christian Filipinos are to be found
in Mindanao and some in Sulu, the Sultans and Datus have dominated
the country. Even Spanish authority never extended over the
southern islands and the garrisons maintained at the seaports were
constantly in fear of massacre.</p>

<p>Leaving the southern islands for the next article, I shall confine
myself at present to Luzon, Panay, Negros, Cebu, Samar and the
smaller islands which make up the Visayan group. These islands
contain the bulk of the territory, a large majority of the people,
most of the material wealth and practically all of the civilization of
the Philippines. Luzon, the largest of the entire group, reaches north
almost to the nineteenth parallel and is about six degrees long. Like
the islands of Japan, it is mountainous and well watered. The other
islands of the group are considerably smaller and extend as far south
as the ninth parallel. They, too, are mountainous, but the valleys
are fertile and support a large population. The principal industry
is agriculture, and the soil produces a variety of cereals, fruits and
vegetables. Rice, as in other oriental countries, is the chief article
of food, though hemp is by far the largest export. The hemp plant
looks so much like the banana that the traveler can scarcely distinguish
between them. Sugar cane is also grown in many parts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the islands and would be cultivated still more largely but for the low
price of raw sugar. Sugar, however, cannot be raised here with the
same profit that it can in Hawaii and Cuba, owing to the fact that it
must be replanted more frequently. Tobacco of an excellent quality
is produced on several of the islands and in sufficient quantities to
supply the home demand (and nearly all Filipinos use tobacco) and
leave a surplus for export.</p>

<p>The cocoanut is a staple product here of great value, and its cultivation
can be indefinitely extended. Of all the crops it probably
yields the largest income on the investment, but as the trees do not
begin to bear until they are about eight years old, they are only
cultivated in small groves or by those who can afford to wait for
returns. Copra, the dried meat of the cocoanut, is now exported to
the value of two and a half million dollars, but systematic effort

<div class="caption"><p class="center">A FILIPINO VILLAGE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The methods of cultivation and the implements used are not as
modern as one would expect. The carabao, or water buffalo, is the
one all-purpose farm animal. Carabaos are something like the American
ox, but are more heavily built; they are uniform in color&mdash;a dark
drab&mdash;and have heavy, flat horns which grow back instead of forward.</p>

<p>The agricultural situation in the islands is at present most distressing.
The fields were devastated by war, and before labor could restore
what the soldiers had destroyed, rinderpest attacked the carabaos and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
in some places carried away as many as 90 per cent of the animals.
We visited a sugar plantation which had lost more than half of its
carabaos during the two weeks preceding. Everywhere one sees fields
overgrown with grass which cannot be cultivated for lack of plow
animals. One can understand something of the rinderpest calamity
when it is remembered that these patient beasts do all the plowing
and all of the hauling in the Philippine Islands. We often see them
ridden, sometimes bearing two persons. In addition to the ravages of
disease and the ruin wrought by arms, the Filipino farmer has suffered
from the closing of his market. When United States authority was
substituted for Spanish rule, the Filipinos lost the advantage which
they had previously had in the Spanish market, and then they were
shut out of the United States by a tariff wall. And to make matters
worse, they now bear the brunt of the Chinese boycott aimed at American
goods. Every speaker who has attempted to voice the sentiments
of the people during our stay in the islands has laid special emphasis
upon the injustice done to the islands by our tariff laws. This subject
was also brought to the attention of Secretary Taft and his party, and
all of the American officials here urge the importance of relief in this
direction.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">FILIPINO HOUSES</p></div>
</div>

<p>The well-to-do Filipinos live in houses modeled after those built by
the Spaniards, but the great majority of the people live in what are
called nipa huts&mdash;light structures made with bamboo frames and with
sides and roofs of nipa palm leaves. The houses are several feet above
the ground and are reached by a ladder or steps. As the temperature
at midday does not change much the year round, the main objects
in building are to secure protection from rain and an abundance of
air, and the nipa hut meets these requirements. The Filipino house
is not only light and airy, but it is inexpensive; we saw a school house
at Santa Barbara built for five hundred pupils at an expense of five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
hundred pesos, or $250 in gold. At some of the military camps,
which we visited, the Filipino style of building has been adopted.</p>

</div>

<p>The Filipino dress is quite like that worn in Europe and America;
among the educated men it is identical. The men of the middle class
wear a shirt of a gauzy material outside the trousers. The women
wear a dress skirt with a long narrow train and a low-necked, wide-sleeved
waist made of jusi (pronounced hoose), or pina (penya)
cloth. A kerchief of the same material folded about the neck completes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
the toilet. All the thin fabrics worn by the women are manufactured
on hand looms kept in the homes.</p>

<p>Iloilo is the center of the jusi cloth manufacture, of which we saw
many beautiful samples during our tour of the islands. The pina
cloth is made from the fibre of a leaf resembling that of the pineapple.
In the province of Balacan a fine quality of silk is made on hand-looms&mdash;the
weaving of fabrics being an accomplishment in which the
women take pride. There is a coarser cloth made of hemp which is
used for ordinary wear, and this is also produced in the home and sold
on market days.</p>

<p>Such conflicting reports have reached the United States regarding
the Filipino people that I was anxious to study them for myself, and
I feel that I am prepared to form an intelligent opinion upon the
subject. I have seen representatives of all occupations in all parts of
the islands, in the cities and in the country. I have conversed with
students and professional men, visited the markets where the rank and
file meet and exchange their products, watched the farmers at work in
the fields and the laborers in the city, and I have made inquiries of
both Americans and natives. The Filipinos are a branch of the Malay
race, but there is such a strong resemblance between some of the individual
Filipinos and the Japanese as to suggest the possibility of a mixing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
of bloods, if not a common origin. At Hong Kong I visited a Filipino
of prominence, and the young lady who admitted me so resembled the
Japanese that I was surprised to learn that she was the daughter of
my host. A few hours later I noticed a young man attending to some
business in a shipping office and supposed him to be a Japanese, but
found that he also was a full blooded Filipino. The Filipinos are a
little darker than the Japanese and may average a little taller, but I
have constantly been reminded of the Land of the Rising Sun during
my stay here.</p>

<p>It is frequently said in disparagement of the Filipinos that they will
not work, but this is answered conclusively by a patent and ever present
fact, viz., that they produce their own food, make their own clothes,
build their own homes and in other ways supply their needs. They
have not the physical strength of the average American, nor have they
the experience in machine labor or in the organization of work, but
they will do more physical labor than a white man can perform in this
climate and they have shown themselves capable of doing the finer
kinds of work when instructed. They are also capable of successful
co-operative effort when under efficient guidance. One of the commission
informed me that the street car system lately inaugurated in
Manila was put in at a labor cost of 40 per cent below the estimate,
the work being done by Filipino laborers under an American contractor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a><br /><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
This is certainly an excellent showing. The operating force
is composed of Filipinos and the cars are run very successfully.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><a name="in_the_philippines" id="in_the_philippines"></a>
<img src="images/ill063.jpg" width="600" height="355" alt="in the philippines" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">IN THE PHILIPPINES</p></div>
</div>

<p>The superintendent of the railroad from Manila to Dagupan, an
Englishman, speaks very highly of the Filipinos employed on the
road. He says that he uses natives entirely for the train service and
that he has not had an accident on the road during the thirteen
years of its operation.</p>

<p>A large company of men were unloading stone and gravel from
barges near our hotel, and they were as industrious and as cheerful
a lot of workmen as one could wish to see. They carried the material
in baskets and accomplished more, so far as I could judge, than the
coolies whom I saw at similar work in China. The Filipino demands
better treatment than that accorded to the coolie, but when employed
by those who understand him and show him proper consideration,
he is both competent and faithful.</p>

<p>In the government printing office nearly nine-tenths of the employés
are natives (and the proportion is increasing), and Mr. Leach,
the public printer, informed me that they readily learned the work
and were able to run the typesetting machines and presses, do the
bookbinding and stereotyping and other skilled work connected
with the office. The newspaper offices of the city also employ native
labor, and I need not remind my readers that the members of the
various typographical unions of the United States are among the
most intelligent of our skilled laborers. We visited the largest tobacco
factory in Manila, the Germinal, and found between twelve and
fifteen hundred men and women making cigars and cigarettes by
hand and by machine. There are several smaller factories, and all
are operated by native labor.</p>

<p>One of the leading furniture manufacturers of Manila is authority
for the statement that in wood carving the Filipino soon becomes
the equal of the Japanese artisan. The Philippine Islands are so
near the Equator that the heat of the sun in the middle of the day
and during the almost twelve months of summer must be taken into
consideration. When due allowance is made for climatic conditions
and for the fact that the inhabitant of the tropics lacks the spur of
necessity which ever urges on the dweller in higher latitudes, one is
inclined to excuse any seeming lack of industry. Sure it is that
those who come here from America and Europe do not as a rule do
enough manual labor to enable a comparison between them and the
natives.</p>

<p>Besides those who work in the fields, on the streets and in the
factories, there is an army of fishermen and boatmen. Fish forms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
a considerable part of the food supply of the island, and these are
brought from the ocean, from the rivers and from the lakes by a
hardy and active people. Much of the commerce is carried by water,
and the boats are manned by natives. Except where the Chinese
have monopolized the mercantile business, the stores are kept by
Filipinos, men and women sharing the labor as they do in France.</p>

<p>And speaking of the
women, it must be remembered
that woman
occupies a much higher
place in the Philippines
than in any other part
of the Orient. The Filipinos
contend that even
before Spanish influence
made itself felt in
the islands, woman was
accorded an equal place
with man and divided
with him both the
honors and the responsibilities
of the home.
However this may be,
it cannot be doubted
that at present the
rights of woman and
her position in the family
and in society are
respected fully as much
as in continental
Europe. Her influence is felt in industrial and
political life as well as
in the church. At one reception a lady law student delivered an excellent
address.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE ACCOMPLISHED WIFE OF A

</div>

<p>Under Spanish rule education was confined to a few. In fact, one
of the indictments brought against the Friars by the natives was that
educational facilities were denied to the masses. This, too, brought
the Jesuits, the friends of education, into conflict with the Friars.
But comparatively few of the people enjoyed the advantages of higher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
education, and these were a controlling influence in their respective
communities. As in Mexico and in Cuba, the cultured men and
women of the Philippines are thoroughly refined and polished in
manner.</p>

<p>The American government has had no difficulty in finding men
competent to fill the offices which have been assigned to the natives,
three of the seven members of the commission and three of the seven
supreme court judges being Filipinos. The governors and mayors are
nearly all Filipinos, as are most of the judges of the lower courts.
As there is no satisfactory service by private boats, the commission
furnished us a coastguard steamer for a tour of the islands, the
passengers paying the cost of subsistence, and we were thus enabled
to visit the principal cities. At all of these places we found a group
of intellectual and public spirited men. At Iloilo, Bacolod, Cebu
and Santa Barbara there were addresses of welcome and public receptions,
and the views of the residents were presented in clear and well
chosen language. At Malolos, the first capital of the Aguinaldo government,
which we visited as the guest of a committee of prominent
Filipinos, similar speeches were delivered, which met with the approval
of the assembled crowd. At Manila a public dinner was given by a
number of representative Filipinos, headed by Mayor Roxas, at which
speeches were made by Filipinos distinguished in official and professional
life. The addresses delivered on these several occasions
would compare favorably with speeches delivered under similar
circumstances in the United States. While some of the persons who
took part in these meetings showed traces of Spanish blood, others
were unmistakably Filipino; but the racial differences could not be
distinguished by the manner in which they performed their parts.</p>

<p>While at Manila I met General Aguinaldo, first at the reception
tendered us by the Elks, and later at his own home in Cavite. Since
his capture he has been living in retirement and has conducted himself
in such a manner as to win the approbation of the American officials.
He is small of stature, modest in deportment and manifests
a deep interest in the welfare of his people. He has twice appealed
to the government to establish an agricultural bank for the relief of the
farmers, calling attention to the scarcity of money and to the high
rate of interest (sometimes 40 or 50 per cent) charged the farmers on
short loans. The agricultural bank was referred to by several speakers
during our stay in the islands, and it is certain that, from an industrial
standpoint, the government could do nothing which would
be more beneficial or acceptable to the people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Apacible, the head of the Hong Kong junta during the insurrection,
now a practicing physician in Manila, was selected by the
Filipino reception committee to accompany us on our trip, and being
personally acquainted with the leaders of thought, he was able to
bring us into contact with those who reflected the opinion of the people,
while Captain Moss, of General Corbin's personal staff, and Collector
Shuster, representing the insular government, kept us in touch
with the Americans in military and civil life. We found everywhere
commendation of the educational system established by the
Americans. It is the one department of work instituted by our
government which seems to have avoided serious criticism. I presented
this universal commendation as evidence of the good intentions
of our people, pointing out to the Filipinos that people are apt
to assert their rights in proportion as they increase in intelligence,
and that our people would not be foolish enough to encourage education
if they really intended to do injustice to the Filipinos.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="night" id="night"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">FILIPINO NIGHT SCHOOL&mdash;AMERICAN TEACHERS</p></div>
</div>

<p>The large increase in the number of students and the interest taken
in the establishment of schools must be taken into consideration by
anyone who attempts to forecast the future of the islands. In many
communities there are more people speaking English to-day than could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
ever speak Spanish, and the multitude of dialects will soon be dissolved
into a common language. One superintendent of schools told me that
in his district the attendance was more than 50 per cent above the
school population, owing to the fact that grown men, and women with
children, insisted upon studying. Another superintendent reported
that she could not find teachers for all the villages which offered to
erect school houses. An incident was related by still another teacher
which illustrates the ambition of the Filipino youth. A Filipino boy,
who was working in the home of an English woman notified his mistress
that he wanted to go to school. Being anxious to keep him,
she offered to raise his wages from twenty pesos per month to forty,
but he rejected the offer, saying that he loved wisdom more than he
loved money.</p>

<p>Besides the public schools, primary, secondary, industrial and normal,
there are a number of religious schools. The Jesuits had their
schools and colleges under Spanish occupation, one of the boys'
schools which we visited at Cebu being older than Harvard University.
The Catholic sisters also have numerous girls' schools throughout
the islands. At Manila the Jesuits have an observatory and weather
bureau which, for equipment and scientific accuracy, probably has no
superior anywhere.</p>

<p>The Protestant churches are also establishing schools, some of them
industrial. Who will measure the effect upon coming generations of
these multiplying agencies for the training of the boys and girls of
the Philippines?</p>

<p>The northern islands are inhabited by a Christian population.
Whatever may be said of the governmental methods of Spain or of
the political corruption of her colonial representatives, she established
the Christian faith in the islands. Prior to American occupation the
higher officials of the church and many of the priests were Spanish,
but since 1900 American and Filipino bishops and priests are being
substituted. Under the lead of Archbishop Harty the work of the
church is being vigorously pushed and a large number of baptisms
are reported. Several of the Protestant churches are gaining a foothold,
there being upwards of ten thousand Filipinos enrolled in the
evangelical churches. The Presbyterian church of the Tondo district,
Manila, has something like four hundred natives, Señor Buencamino,
secretary of state under Aguinaldo, and afterwards a member
of the civil service commission, being president of the Tondo congregation.</p>

<p>No discussion of the religious situation in the Philippines would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
complete without a reference to the independent Catholic church of
which Señor Gregoria Agilpay is the head. Obispo Maximo Aglipay
is a native Filipino, 46 years old, with an intelligent face and fine
presence. In three and a half years he has established a church with
some three hundred priests and about seven hundred congregations.
He claims a membership of about four million, but the clergy of the
regular Catholic church do not concede nearly so large a following.
In fact, they deny that he has made any considerable impression upon
the Catholic population, and as there is no accurate church census,
it is impossible to say in what proportion the Catholic membership is
divided between these two church organizations.</p>

<p>As to the honesty of the average Filipino, different opinions are
to be heard from Americans, but we are told that less care is taken to
lock the doors than in America, which would indicate less fear of
burglary. The Philippine court records would embarrass us if we
became too harsh in our reflections upon the integrity of the Filipino,
for during the years 1902-3-4-5 thirty office-holding Americans were
found guilty of shortages and defalcations, the total amount embezzled
exceeding seventy thousand dollars, gold. Bilibid prison at Manila
is the penitentiary for the northern islands and most (I think all)
who receive more than a jail sentence are confined here. There are
now about forty-six hundred prisoners in Bilibid, nearly eleven hundred
serving terms for brigandage, insurrection, rebellion and sedition&mdash;the
remainder for other crimes. If the convicts average a year's
sentence each, the number of natives sent to the penitentiary during
four years would have to be about twenty-five thousand, to give the
native population a criminal class equal to the proportion which the
thirty convicted Americans bear to the entire American population
in the islands, and it must be remembered that the defalcations have
been among Americans selected because of their supposed character
and capacity. There have been many defalcations among the fiscal
officers appointed among the natives, but not knowing the total number
of the Filipinos occupying fiduciary positions and the number of
Americans occupying similar positions, I can not make a comparison.
Our chief consolation is to be found in the fact that Americans guilty
of dishonesty have been promptly punished by the American officials,
but this does not entirely remove the stain which their conduct has
brought upon our nation's good name.</p>

<p>I can not conclude this article without expressing my appreciation
of the courtesy shown me by Acting Governor Ide, Secretary Furguson,
the members of the Philippine commission and the other officials, civil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
and military. They were all willing to furnish information, records
and statistics regarding the things done under American authority.
While mistakes have been made, some of them expensive; while there
have been outrages by the constabulary (which is merely a native army
officered by Americans and serving under another name) and while
there have been instances of seeming partiality to Americans where
a conflict has occurred between them and natives, I believe that the
serious evils to be complained of are not personal, but are inherent in
a colonial system and can not be eradicated so long as such a system
is maintained.</p>

<p>The greatest need that I noted in the islands is an increase in what
we call the middle class, but this need is noticeable in the other Spanish
colonies which I have visited and will be corrected as education
increases among the masses. With more education among the farmers
there will be improved methods of agriculture, and with more education
among the artisans will come diversification of industry. This middle
class will be a balance wheel, as it were, to regulate the machinery of
society, and it will furnish a public opinion which will control official
representatives.</p>

<p class="center"><em>The following extracts concerning Mr. Bryan's visit are taken
from Filipino papers:</em></p>

<p>December 27, El Renacimiento, said editorially:</p>

<p>"Bryan. This is a name among names. Others may boast of it but
in their cases it does not mean so much. The daily press to-day fills
column after column regarding him and his name is in the mouths of
everyone. The events of yesterday claim special notice, consisting, as
they do, of more than mere generalities.</p>

<p>"Why do these simple people salute us? Do they treat the Americans
here this way? These are questions which were asked of his companions
during the trip through Paranaque, Las Pinas and Bacoor
yesterday.</p>

<p>"'The salutations are for you,' replied a prominent Filipino, 'because
they know that it is you who is approaching. These people do
not know you, but they have learned that you are here and your name
is revered by them.'</p>

<p>"In fact few names of Americans can be mentioned among Filipinos
which will excite more feeling. Bryan did not need to come here in
order to be popular.</p>

<p>"The principal impression produced by his presence, even upon his
adversaries in politics, is his consummate amiability and discretion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Bryan has made no statements or passed any judgment regarding the
Philippine administration. He has not given any excuse for his
being characterized as an agitator or a scoffer at the enterprise which
the United States, as a nation, has undertaken in these islands.</p>

<p>"But does this signify that Bryan will abstain from collecting data
for future use? We believe not. One can easily hope for a highly
optimistic opinion from him,
but a party man takes his
ideas and prejudices with
him wherever he goes and he
sees things through the light
of his convictions."</p>

<p>One Manila paper prints
the following:</p>

<p>The Elks gave a rousing
reception last night to William
Jennings Bryan at the
club house on the Luneta,
and all of Manila turned out
to do homage to their distinguished
guest. The club
rooms were artistically arranged
with flags and potted
plants and the spacious halls
were the scene of many
groups of well-known faces.</p>

<p>Punch and lemonade were
served during the evening
and the music was furnished
by the constabulary band.</p>

<p>The guests were received
by Colonel Dorrington and
Mrs. Dorrington, Governor
Ide and Mr. and Mrs. Bryan, and were ushered by Messrs. Reiser, Patstone,
Steward and Fisher.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">A FILIPINO BELLE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>There was considerable stir when Emilio Aguinaldo entered the
hall and was ushered up to the receiving party. He was introduced
to Mr. Bryan by Governor Ide. Aguinaldo said in Spanish, "I am
glad to meet you; I have been very anxious to see you. I have heard
a great deal of you." This was interpreted to Mr. Bryan who said,
"We have heard your name in our country also." Then Mr. Bryan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
said, taking hold of Aguinaldo's arm and turning to Mrs. Bryan, "This
is Aguinaldo."</p>

<p>At a meeting of prominent native citizens held in the office of the
president of the municipal board and presided over by that official, the
following program for entertaining Mr. Bryan was decided upon:</p>

<p>A public banquet at one of the hotels of Manila.</p>

<p>An evening entertainment at the Liceo de Manila, at 4 o'clock p. m.,
on January 6, with the following program:</p>

<p>1. Parade of the students.</p>

<p>2. Address of welcome to the Honorable William Jennings Bryan.</p>

<p>3. Band.</p>

<p>4. Speech by Mr. Bryan.</p>

<p>5. Theatrical performance by the students of the college.</p>

<p>The Manila Times of January 1 gave an account of the popular
banquet given to Mr. Bryan in the Luzon restaurant. From this report
the following extracts are taken:</p>

<p>At the popular banquet held in honor of William Jennings Bryan
last Friday night in the Luzon restaurant, the distinguished guest
showed the same caution as at Malolos in dealing with the questions of
policy affecting these islands, never at any time doing more than
skirting issues which if not dead are generally quiescent.</p>

<p>About 150 guests sat down at the tables, though when the speaking
began there were probably close on 300 persons present, most of the
new arrivals being young Filipinos of the class which made itself
prominent in the "Independence Day" held recently before the visiting
congressmen in Marble hall.</p>

<p>The program, which was somewhat artistically designed, had on its
first page the Stars and Stripes; inside, the picture of Mr. Bryan and
the menus and names of the committee of organization, and on the last
page the Katipunan emblem of the rising sun and the three stars. During
the evening the Rizal orchestra discoursed music at intervals.</p>

<p>Generally, the speaking was too long; Judge Yusay, who occupied a
place on the program, consuming an hour in a speech which finally
tired its hearers. Mr. Bryan, the last orator, did not close his remarks
till half-past one.</p>

<p>In his own speech he took occasion to say that he did not feel at
liberty to speak freely as he would in the United States. Two or three
times when his remarks were leading to a climax whose logical sequel
appeared to be some reference to independence, his audience waited almost
breathlessly, but he carefully evaded the seemingly logical denouement
and ended in some relevant but not thrilling expression, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a><br /><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
could sense rather than hear the sigh, in some cases of relief, in others
of disappointment, which followed.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">EMILIO AGUINALDO, MOTHER, SISTER, BROTHER AND SON</p></div>
</div>

<p>His address dwelt chiefly on two thoughts, the first being that there
is a tie which binds all mankind together, that tie being knit up with
the human heart, and the second being what constitutes civilization
and how it may be attained.</p>

<p>The following report is taken from the Manila Times of December
28:</p>

<p>"Independence the Soonest Possible."</p>

<p>"Malolos Obliged."</p>

<p>"Mr. Bryan, the Hope of Our Nationality."</p>

<p>"W. J. Bryan, Defendant of Our Liberty."</p>

<p>Such were the legends mounted upon the arches under which William
Jennings Bryan passed from the railroad station to Malolos on the
occasion of his provincial excursion yesterday. The trip was made by
the famous democrat, in company with his wife and children, as guests
of Mr. Higgins. The private car of Mr. Higgins and an extra coach
took the party first to Gapan, where it arrived about 9:30 a. m., after
having stopped at several of the stations en route, where Bryan made
short addresses to the delegations, which were in attendance at the
stations with bands of music and banners flying to greet him.</p>

<p>At Malolos, the seat of the former revolutionary government and
the center of operations of the prime movers in the "independencia"
campaign, luncheon was had at the home of Mrs. Tanchanco, an opulent
Filipino matron. After the luncheon was over Teodoro Sandico
rose to introduce Sr. De Luce, who addressed the following words to
the assembled guests:</p>

<p>"I salute the real champion of a democratic people, the true defender
of the rights of the people; he who at Kansas City included in
his platform the independence of the Philippine Islands. I am sorry
that his presence in Malolos, once the capital of a Filipino republic,
is so short. So deep-rooted is the desire for independence in the Filipino
people that the news of the arrival of this champion has brought
to Malolos many from all about, only to greet their savior. Such
spontaneous manifestations by all grades of people will, I believe, convince
you that we desire our independence at once. It will show you
that we have a right to nationality, that we have everything that is
necessary to support a government of our own. If the government
will give us this independence it will show it is the champion of liberty
as it did in its treatment of Cuba. Such a step here will eliminate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
the need of a great American army twice its natural size, and it
would avoid the corruption of the principles inherited from the ancestors
of Americans. If America will not give us full independence,
grant us a democratic government! Separate the executive and legislative
branches! Give us real independence of the judiciary! We
drink a health to those who have not forgotten the true principles
of Americans."</p>

<p>After the toast to the great
orator had been drank, Bryan
rose to his feet and addressed
some two or three hundred
natives, aside from those who
were gathered at luncheon. The
following is his address:</p>

<p>"Allow me to thank you for
the welcome you have extended
to my family and to me. I
appreciate also the kindly manner
in which you have referred
to the way in which I have tried
to express my friendship for the
Filipino people. I do not propose
to discuss here political
questions. I have not felt that
in these islands I should enter
on any disputed questions.</p>

<p>"Some things I can say with
propriety. While you appreciate
the manner in which I
have attempted to show my
friendship for the Filipinos, do not make the mistake of believing that
those who differ from me are not interested in this people. In my country
there are two great political parties, republican and democratic.
They enter into contests which are strenuous, but in fundamental principles
both are the same. Thomas Jefferson founded the democratic
party. Abraham Lincoln was the first great republican. Lincoln has
left records to show the admiration that he felt for the principles and
utterances of Thomas Jefferson.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">A FILIPINO TEACHER.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"In two contests I was defeated by the republicans, but I believe
as much in the patriotism of those who voted against me as I do
in the patriotism of those who fought for me. Those who agreed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
with me announced a policy for the Philippines. Those who opposed
me did not. But do not make the mistake of believing that
those others are enemies to the islands. I believe the majority of all
American people without regard to politics or party are sincere well
wishers of the Filipinos. Yes, all.</p>

<p>"However you may differ about policies, all your people speak well
of what our country stands for in regard to education. Let me remind
you that these little children who are attending school speak
more eloquently in your behalf than I am able to do. The more
educated people you have among you the easier will be the task for
those who speak for you in the United States. The more respect your
people show for the law the easier will be the task for those who
speak for you. The higher the ideals shown in your language
and your lives the easier the task of those who speak for you.
I want you to have as much confidence in the republicans in power
as I have, though I have been twice defeated by them. And when I
say this I am not trying to pay them for anything. I do not owe
them anything. When I say trust them, I say it because I believe
the American people want to do right and, given the time, will find
out what is right on every question.</p>

<p>"Differences of opinion must be expected. In fact, that people
differ in opinion is to their credit rather than to their discredit.
Those who agree in everything do not as a rule think on anything.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
Differences of opinion must not only be expected but must be respected.
Do not expect our people to administer authority here without
mistakes. They make mistakes at home, and if we democrats get
into power, good as we are, we will make mistakes. The Spanish made
mistakes here, and so would the Filipinos. I suggest that if you want
to help us who are interested in you, you can do it by supporting with
all the enthusiasm you have, the efforts made by America here. Let
us hope that whoever is in authority here and there, they will have
the wisdom to so promote the welfare of all, as to unite both peoples
in an eternal affection."</p>

<p>Conception Felix, the president of the Women's Association of the
Philippines, followed Mr. Bryan and spoke of the duty of the islands
in securing for them the best advantages for their welfare, and concluded
with the statement that the women of the Philippine Islands
demanded their independence.</p>

<p>After leaving Malolos the trip to Pasig was made and the return
to Manila was so timed as to allow the party to arrive at Santa Mesa
in good season. A special car of the street railway company met it
there.</p>

<p>At the reception given at Bacolod, on the island of Negros, January
5, Señor Joaquin Jortich spoke as follows:</p>

<p>"Hon. William Jennings Bryan and distinguished party&mdash;Gentlemen:</p>

<p>"The people of Bacolod and the province in general, through me,
have to-day the honor of greeting their distinguished visitors, giving
to them all a most cordial and sincere welcome, and very especially
to the illustrious leader of the democratic party who has deigned to
grant us the high distinction of his visit.</p>

<p>"Mr. Bryan has doubtless noticed since he set foot on Filipino soil
that the people of the islands received him as if he were an old and
beloved friend.</p>

<p>"There is nothing strange in this; one of the most striking qualities
of the Filipino is gratitude, even though his enemies and detractors
assert the contrary. The Filipino people know that Mr. Bryan
has been and is a sincere champion of the Filipino ideals and interests
in America, and this little suffices to make all here, without distinction,
receive him to-day with open arms and with hearts swelling
with joy.</p>

<p>"His visit to-day to this province gives us the satisfaction of knowing
him personally, as well as the opportunity of expressing our true
sentiments toward the North American people, to whom we hope to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
make our humble voice heard through the channel of our illustrious
visitor.</p>

<p>"The Filipino people can not fail to thank Providence which has
appointed to them the good fortune of being under the protection
of the noble and powerful Stars and Stripes.</p>

<p>"No one familiar with the history of the constitution of North
America can fail to admire the spirit of wisdom and morality which
permeates its most liberal institutions.</p>

<p>"It is true that the Philippines bill is not in every way based upon
the principles which that constitution breathes, and it is also true
that in the government administration there exist certain prejudices
which find no place in so wise a constitution; but those defects are
errors which we hope will be rectified in time and through the education
of the people.</p>

<p>"To deny that the Filipino people aspire to independence in the
future would be to deny the light of the sun in broad day. But in
spite of this aspiration, we understand that peoples, like men, in order
to be independent must necessarily pass in strictly chronological order,
through different stages, which they can not traverse by leaps and
bounds. Nor do we fail to realize that the liberty, great or small,
which may be granted to a people, must be in direct relation to the
state of their culture.</p>

<p>"Our ambition is just and within the bounds of reason and logic. We
wish independence through evolution, because we understand that a
people, differing from another in race and in its ethnographical and
ethnological conditions, can never be governed with justice and equity
except by itself; and this, because the pride of superiority will always
dominate the governing race to the detriment of the governed, and
the latter will never be happy. Some of the congressmen and senators
who were here a short time ago have said in Washington that the
Filipino people are growing away from the American people. That
statement is by no means as clear as it should be.</p>

<p>"The Filipino people, by virtue of being a tropical race, are very
sensitive, and with the same impetuosity with which they love and
admire a benefactor, they hate and despise a tyrant.</p>

<p>"The American people have brought us in the Philippines many
things of great value; they have bestowed upon us many benefits and
have granted us many liberties which formerly we did not enjoy; but it
is also true that among the good things they have brought some evils;
among the benefits there have sprung up like brambles certain unjust
abuses, and among the many liberties conceded us petty tyrants have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
arisen to restrict them. Therefore, the Filipino people have grown
away from the bad Americans, but in no way from the American
people to whom we owe but gratitude and love.</p>

<p>"We love those who love us and despise those who despise us.
However defective our past civilization may have been, it has left in
our hearts the feeling of dignity which befits a people of culture.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, in the Philippines, not all those who are here as
Americans possess the noble sentiments of the American people, whom
we admire and love, for we would be contemptible did we, through
the fault of some bad representatives, come to hate an entire nation
which has been and is lending us its aid.</p>

<p>"Our illustrious visitor has proof positive of my assertion. The
Filipino people, without knowing him personally, receive him with
open arms and as to an old and beloved friend open to him their
hearts, telling him their troubles.</p>

<p>"This is the Filipino people, these are their real feelings towards
the people of North America.</p>

<p>"We trust that these prejudices may disappear in time, as these two
races, destined to live together, continue on the road of mutual sympathy
and a better understanding.</p>

<p>"With regard to our present situation, from an administrative
standpoint, although we are relatively better off than formerly, nevertheless
there are in the present government many defects which merit
censure.</p>

<p>"Against such defects we shall continue to struggle until the Philippines
possess a legislative body which shall know better than that
of to-day the needs and conditions of this people.</p>

<p>"At present we have no legislative body but the civil commission,
composed of three Filipino members, without portfolios, and four
American members with them. The latter members, the majority
of whom do not know the country in its inside phases, clearly can
never dictate laws which are adapted to the circumstances and conditions
of the people.</p>

<p>"The Philippine archipelago is very diverse in its ethnographical
and ethnological conditions, and, therefore, it is very difficult to frame
a law which is adapted to its general necessities, unless one has an
accurate and profound knowledge of the situation and conditions of
each and every one of the thirty-some provinces which form the
archipelago.</p>

<p>"Another of the greatest defects which we observe in the present government
is the inequality and lack of justice in the appointments of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
government positions, as between Filipinos and Americans, with the
exception of the judiciary which is the department most evenly distributed.</p>

<p>"In the civil commission and in the provincial boards the voice
of the Filipino is not in the majority, neither, therefore, is the voice
of the people. It is true that the municipalities appear to operate
with the fullest liberty, but this liberty is restricted, because the
provincial board exercise direct control over all their acts, so that
municipal autonomy is, as a matter of fact, nominal.</p>

<p>"The most noble and acceptable institution which American government
has established here is that of public instruction. Even the
officials in that department are also the best liked and those upon
the most friendly terms with the Filipino people, although defects are
not entirely absent as is the case with every human creation. Against
this department we can say nothing up to the present. God grant
that it may continue so for many years, without being affected by the
discord and prejudice which the enemies of the country seek to sow.</p>

<p>"With respect to the economic phase, we could be no worse off than
we are now, and this can be easily explained. Since the year 1896,
in which the revolution against Spain commenced, the Philippines
have gone from bad to worse in all their economic conditions, particularly
in the matter of agriculture which is the sole source of their
wealth. Of 56,000,000 acres of land which we have fit for cultivation,
only 6,000,000 acres are cultivated and 50,000,000 are not
cultivated. War, drouth, cholera and rinderpest among our work
animals, have prostrated us to such an extent that all which the farmer
might say of the situation pales before the reality. To these inferior
troubles must be added others on the outside, the lack of market for
our sugar; Japan, protecting herself from Formosa, raises her custom
tariff upon sugar; China, with the boycott, closes her market to us
because of our relations with America, and rich America, which
should protect us, also closes her doors to us with a Dingley tariff.</p>

<p>"To sum up, the Philippines have no money, they have no production,
they have no market. Could there be a harder situation?</p>

<p>"The plantations paralyzed and the laborers without work&mdash;thus rises
the germ of ladronism. The scarcity of money is such that in order
to find a dollar to-day one needs a searchlight, and to make matters
worse the articles of prime necessity rise in price, making existence
almost impossible for the poor workman.</p>

<p>"In the time of the Spanish government there were in circulation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
some two hundred million of Mexican pesos, to-day we have hardly
thirty million, according to the last report of the secretary of finance,
a sum which, when divided among eight million inhabitants, gives
3.75 pesos per capita.</p>

<p>"If to this we add the stoppage of all business through the paralysis
of commerce and the industries, it will be seen that with 3.75 pesos
for each inhabitant, pauperism, hunger and misery are necessary
consequences.</p>

<p>"Here we have the actual state of the Philippines, whose competition
the powerful sugar trust in America still fears. America needs
three million tons of sugar for her home consumption; her production
amounts to only one million tons, so that she must import two million
tons from abroad. The Philippines produce only three million piculs
of sugar, or about 187,500 tons. Is it possible to dream of competition?</p>

<p>"Our money crisis can only be met by the establishment of agricultural
mortgage banks, and if we wish to escape disaster in that
enterprise it is necessary that its administration be completely separated
from the government, with the exception of the usual powers of
inspection, this because it is well known that prosperity in these affairs
is based upon mercantile interest, which does not exist in government
officials, whose interests are political rather than mercantile. As proof
of this statement let us look at what happened with the $3,000,000
which the national government donated to the insular government
to improve the grievous situation of the country. With all our soul
we are grateful for so generous a gift, but we greatly regret that the
government has not known how to administer it better. The $3,000,000
have been exhausted, but the situation of the country has not
improved in the slightest degree. That was, indeed, a disaster.</p>

<p>"To-day questions involving many millions are being discussed and
it would be very lamentable if the protection and good wishes of the
national government should come to naught through a mistaken or
defective administration. Our agricultural crisis is due rather to the
terrible mortality of the work animals, which is to-day extending to
all classes of cattle. This is a misfortune from which we have been
suffering since the year 1901. Five years of massacre, no stock in
the world will stand it.</p>

<p>"To remedy this state of affairs we need machinery which will take
the place of the work animals, and we believe that the free entry of
every class of machinery for a definite time would be one of the most
efficacious means of fomenting and encouraging the many lines of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
industry which we have to exploit, and, therefore, of raising the
country from the state of prostration in which it is found.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<h3>THE PHILIPPINES&mdash;THE MORO COUNTRY.</h3>


<p>The term Moro is used to describe the Mohammedan Filipino and
includes a number of tribes occupying the large island of Mindanao,
the smaller islands adjacent to it and those of the Sulu archipelago.</p>

<p>The northeast corner of Mindanao is separated from the island of
Leyte by the Surigao Strait, and that part of Mindanao has considerable
sprinkling of Christian Filipinos, but both that island and the
Sulus can be considered Moro country. The Americans recognize the
difference between the two groups of islands and administer government
according to different plans. Civil government has been established
in the northern islands, and except where ladronism prevails,
law and order reign. There are in some places, as in northern Luzon,
wild tribes in the mountains, but these are so few in number and so
different from the civilized Filipinos that they do not enter into the
solution of the Philippine problem.</p>

<p>In Mindanao, however, and the other Moro provinces warlike tribes
have been in control. They have furnished a large number of pirates
and have frequently invaded the northern island, carrying back Filipino
slaves. They never acknowledged the authority of Spain and
succeeded in keeping most of the island in the southern group free
from Spanish control. Our country probably exercises authority over
more Moro territory than Spain ever did, and yet our authority is
limited and we employ the military form of government rather than
the civil.</p>

<p>In our tour of the islands we crossed over the narrow part of Mindanao,
went up the Cotabato valley and called upon the Sultan of
Sulu at his home near Maibun on the island of Sulu.</p>

<p>We landed at Camp Overton, a military post on Iligan bay on the
north coast of Mindanao, and immediately began the ascent to Camp
Kiethley, eighteen miles in the interior. A military road has been
constructed between these two camps, following for the greater part
of the way the Spanish trail. Owing to the heavy rainfall and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
luxuriant growth of vegetation it is difficult to keep a road in repair,
and not far from the coast we passed a large number of prisoners who
were engaged in straightening and improving it. About three miles
from the coast we made a short detour in order to see the famous
Argus Falls, and they are well worth seeing. The Argus river, which
at this point is a larger stream, falls two hundred and twenty feet and
rushes by a tortuous route through the narrow walls of a gorge. The
falls are not only picturesque, but they suggest the possibility of
future use. It has been calculated that one hundred thousand horse
power is here going to waste. The military authorities have been
trying to secure an appropriation for an electric railroad from Camp
Overton to Camp Kiethley with the intention of obtaining power from
the falls, but this would utilize only a small fraction of the energy
which the Argus possesses. Two miles farther up the road we turned
aside to see the rapids of the same river and here made our first
acquaintance with the Moros. We found a dozen of them under a
rude shed of palm leaves preparing the evening meal. The most
conspicuous dish, at least the dish that attracted our attention, was
a skillet full of grasshoppers being done to a neat brown over a slow
fire. While we were watching them, two half bare children returned
from the chase with a large supply of fresh grasshoppers strung upon
grass. The Moros have a most repulsive habit of dyeing the teeth
black, the enamel being first scraped off. Add to this the red tinge
left on the lips by chewing of the betel nut and the mouth is anything
but beautiful. The clothing of the Moros is scanty and of a
cheap quality. The men, when at work, often wear nothing but a
breech cloth. When dressed up they wear very tight fitting trousers
of gay color; a tight fitting waist and a turban completes their company
dress. A garment much worn by men and women is the
sarong, which is a piece of cloth sewed together like a roller towel
and folded about the body. The men, no matter what else they
wear or fail to wear, have a scarf wound around the waist in which
they carry a knife, of which there are several varieties, the bolo, the
sarong and the kris being the most popular. The Moros above mentioned
consented to having a snapshot taken, and their spokesman
informed us in broken English that he had visited the St. Louis
Exposition. Captain McCoy, one of General Wood's staff, who accompanied
us as far as Zamboanga, explained to us that a number of
Moros were sent to St. Louis as an experiment and that they had
returned very much impressed with what they saw in the United
States.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>As we proceeded on the road to Kiethley we passed the spot where
a sergeant was cut to pieces by the Moros three weeks before. While
all the Moros carry knives and are expert in their use, they set a high
estimate upon a gun, and the hapless traveler who carries one of these
envied weapons is apt to be waylaid, if alone, and lose his life as a
penalty for his rashness. With this incident fresh in his memory,
Col. Steever, of Camp Overton, furnished us with a mounted guard.
During the first part of the ride we passed through a forest in which
there were many large trees, some of them with fantastic trunks,
others festooned with vines and all surrounded by a thick undergrowth
which furnish an admirable cover for reptiles, beasts or
hostile natives. A boa-constrictor, thirty-six feet long, was recently
killed not far from the road on which we traveled.</p>

<p>I have referred to the killing of the sergeant and mentioned the
reason sometimes given. It is to be regretted that we occasionally
lose men for reasons that reflect upon us. Governor Devore, whose
jurisdiction extends over a part of Mindanao, officially reports the
killing of one soldier in a quarrel which grew out of an attempt by
the soldier to secure native wine without paying for it.</p>

<p>The latter part of the ride was through a series of small hills
covered with cogon grass. The soil looks like it might be very fertile,
and we passed one little ranch where an American had set out some
hemp plants, but there was little evidence of cultivation along the line.</p>

<p>Camp Kiethley is about twenty-three hundred feet above the sea
on a hill which bears the same name, and commands a beautiful view
of the surrounding country. The ocean can be seen to the north,
and to the south a magnificent mountain lake stretches away for twenty
miles. A regiment under the command of Col. Williams is stationed
here, and this is considered one of the most healthful situations in
the Philippine Islands. The American officers insist that Mindanao
has a better climate than Luzon, and some of them are enthusiastic
about the possibility of drawing American settlers to the island.
General Wood has given much attention to the products and climatic
conditions, and has encouraged the coming of Americans to Mindanao.
Some two hundred of these have settled about Davao bay in the
southeastern part of the island and are cultivating hemp. I found,
however, that most of the members of the military circle were counting
the months intervening before the time of their return to the States.
The ride across Lake Lanao took us in sight of some hostile country
whose inhabitants still refuse to acknowledge allegiance to the United
States. Some of the cottas, or forts, from which Moros have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
driven within a few months were pointed out to us. Governor Devore
is building a model town on the shore of the lake and hopes to convince
the natives of the friendly intentions of our country.</p>

<p>Camp Vickars is only a few miles south of the lake and near the
summit of the divide. The elevation here is twenty-nine hundred
feet and the site for the camp is well chosen. It is about twenty-two
miles from this point down to Malabang, the seaport on Llana
bay, and Captain Foster, who is in command at Camp Vickars,
furnished us with a mounted escort. The ride down to the sea was
even more enjoyable than the trip to Camp Kiethley, the road leading
through forests more dense and foliage more varied. The journey
was enlivened by the sight of a number of monkeys sporting in the
trees and by the discordant notes of the horn-bill. There is a waterfall
on the south side of the range also, nearly half way down the summit,
which, while it does not compare with the Argus Falls, could be
used for the development of several thousand horse power.</p>

<p>The camp at Malabang, now under command of Col. Varnum, has
a splendid water supply derived from several large springs, but the
harbor is so poor that the government is preparing to remove the
camp to Parang, about twenty miles south, where there is an excellent
harbor.</p>

<p>At Malabang we took our boat again, it having gone around the
island while we crossed over, and proceeded to Cotabata near the
mouth of the Rio Grande river. Acting Governor Boyd met us here
with a river steamer and took us to his headquarters about thirty-five
miles further up the river. We had a double purpose in making
this trip, first to see one of the most fertile valleys on the island; and,
second, to pay our respects to Datu Piang, a friendly Moro of considerable
influence among the natives. The Rio Grande is a crooked
stream, wending its way through the high grass, the monotony being
broken now and then by cocoanut groves, rice fields, mango trees,
banana plants and hemp. While there is no such systematic cultivation
here as in the northern islands, there is enough to show the
possibilities of the soil.</p>

<p>The moon was shining brightly when we approached Governor
Boyd's camp, and we were greeted by a salute of lantakas (small brass
cannon) so numerous that we lost all count. Datu Piang had inquired
of the governor how many guns should be fired and was told that as
I held no official position, he could use his own discretion as to the
number. In order that he might not err on the side of too few, he
fired between fifty and a hundred. We had scarcely disembarked
before he came in state to make an official call, seated on the roof of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
his vinta, or ceremonial barge, manned by forty oarsmen. He was
accompanied by his leading datus, his Mohammedan Arab advisor
and his East Indian interpreter. He brought with him also his two
sons and two of the sons of the late Datu Ali, who met a violent death
last fall at the hands of the American troops.</p>

<p>I regret that we were not able to secure a photograph of him as
he approached, for it was a sight of royalty such as we had not before
witnessed. No language can convey the impression that he made
upon us as he approached the shore, smoking a cigar and flanked on
either side by a brown skinned urchin bearing an open umbrella of
red silk trimmed with wide yellow fringe. He stayed long enough
to compliment the American officials and to commend Judge Powell,
who happened to be with us, for treating the rich and the poor alike.
Piang's sons and the younger son of Datu Ali have been studying
English under the instruction of Governor Boyd's wife, and they
showed creditable progress in arithmetic as well as in the use of the
language. Piang said that he wanted the boys to finish their education
in the United States.</p>

<p>Datu Piang is not of royal blood; in fact, he is part Chinese, but
he showed himself so able a financier that he became indispensable to
Ali, the reigning Datu, and gave his daughter, Minka, to him in
marriage. When the Americans entered the valley, Piang counseled
surrender, but Ali went on the war path and he and his father-in-law
became such bitter enemies that the latter refused to receive his
daughter into his house after Ali's death, until urged to do so by the
American officers.</p>

<p>We returned with Piang in his barge and spent a half an hour at
his house. In that dimly lighted upper room there gathered a dusky,
half-bare crowd of men and women and children, in the center of
which sat Minka, the child-widow, just recovering from the wounds
which she received at the time of her husband's death. I never felt
more deeply, than when I looked upon them, the responsibility of our
nation, or more anxious that our country shall so act as to bring to
these people the largest possible amount of good. One would be hard
hearted, indeed, who could see in them and in their habitation nothing
but the possibility of exploitation.</p>

<p>When we left, Piang gave a lantaka to each of the men in our party,
and to some of us spears and knives in addition, while the ladies were
remembered with vessels of brass, of native manufacture, and sarongs.
If our visit had been a hostile one, the cannons and weapons carried
away would have made it memorable, for many expeditions have
returned with less of the spoils of war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>Our next stop was at Zamboanga, the most important port on
the island and the headquarters of Governor Wood. The harbor at
the city is not very well protected, but there is a little bay about
eight miles away which affords both deep water and shelter. We
found more Americans at Zamboanga than at any point outside of
Manila, nearly all of
them being in the service
of the government.
We visited two Moro
schools here and listened
to an address of
welcome in English delivered
by one of the
students. Dr. Saleeby,
an Armenian, is the superintendent
of schools
in Zamboanga and has
furnished a great deal
of information in regard
to the tradition,
history and customs of
the Moros. He has also
prepared primers in
Arabic for the Moros of
Mindanao and the Sulu
Islands.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 244px;"><a name="moros" id="moros"></a>
<img src="images/ill072.jpg" width="244" height="450" alt="moros" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">MOROS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Our tour of the
islands ended at Jolo, or
rather at Maibun, on
the other side of the
island. Jolo is the chief
seaport of the Sulus,
and the Spanish alternated
with the natives
in occupying the space
within the walled city.
A guard is still kept at
the gate and the Moros are not allowed to remain within the walls at
night. They enter freely during the day, but are required to leave their
weapons outside the gate. There are only five Americans in Jolo, besides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
the government officials; two of these keep restaurants, two have
saloons and the fifth has recently opened a photograph gallery.</p>

<p>Just outside of the city walls there is a Chinese village (as there
is also at Zamboanga), the mercantile business being largely in the
hands of the Chinese in both of these towns. There are a number
of Christian Filipinos at both Zamboanga and Jolo.</p>

<p>The sultan of Sulu used to live in Jolo when the Spanish were
not there, but during their occupancy of the town, and since, he
has lived at Maibun on the opposite shore some ten miles distant.
Major Stafford, who is in command of the post there, in the absence of
Colonel Scott, invited the sultan to come to Jolo on the day of our
arrival, and he appeared promptly on time. So much has been written
of him in the United States that the readers of these articles may
be interested in a description from life. He came on a pony, accompanied
by a servant, who held over him a large red umbrella, and
followed by a retinue of datus, head men and small boys. A native
band beat drums and tom-toms as the procession moved along. The
sultan himself was dressed in modern clothes, but all the rest wore
the native dress. His single-breasted, long-tailed blue broadcloth coat
was buttoned to the throat with gold buttons and his trousers were of
the same material. He wore tan shoes and a fez of black and red, and
carried a gold-headed ivory cane given him by the Philippine commission
upon his last visit to Manila. He is small of stature, but
compact in build, and carries himself with dignity and reserve.
His teeth are black and he shares with his countrymen a fondness
for the betel nut and tobacco. His prime minister, Haji
Butu, who accompanied him, speaks more English than the sultan,
though the latter is able to use a few words. After a short call we
all repaired to a hall near by where a spear dance had been arranged,
and we saw the natives, men and women, go through native dances
which, in some respects, resemble those of the American Indian.</p>

<p>The next morning we crossed the island under the protection of a
troop of cavalry and returned the sultan's call. (A few miles from
the trail stands a mountain<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> where about eighty Moros still refuse
allegiance to our government.) He lives in a nipa house but has a
frame building covered with galvanized iron (still unfinished) in
which he receives his guests. He sent for one of his wives (of whom
he has four); he has three or four concubines, he does not know
which, but these are not included in the list of wives. The prime<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
minister has four wives and two concubines, and one of the head men,
at whose house we stopped on the way, had several wives. The sultan
said that the wives were usually kept in separate houses, but that
his lived together in one house.</p>

<p>The sultana, whom we saw, was dressed in silk, with trousers of red
and white striped satin and wore high heeled shoes. She has a
strong face, one of the most intelligent that we saw in Sulu. Both
the sultan and his wife wore diamond and pearl rings. At our request
the sultan brought forth his diamonds and pearls and exhibited his
uniforms, heavy with gold braid and buttons. He is now drawing a
salary of about five thousand dollars a year from the American
government for exerting his influence in our behalf, and as a matter
of economy it might be cheaper to put the datus on the pay roll
than to suppress them by force of arms. His salary, however, is
probably due as much to his being the head of the church as to his
fighting qualities.</p>

<p>We sailed from Maibun to the Bornean coast in order to take a
steamer for Singapore, and as we are studying colonialism, it was
probably fortunate that we did, for we found a few foreigners developing
North Borneo with Chinese coolies, the natives being lost sight
of entirely.</p>

<p>At Sandakan there are thirty-eight English, two Germans and two
thousand Chinese, but we searched in vain for a native. In and
about Kudat, another Bornean port, there are twenty-two Europeans
and ten thousand Chinese, and here we found only a few of the
original inhabitants. At Labuan there are about twenty-five foreigners,
and the local business is in the hands of the Chinese and East
Indians.</p>

<p>I refer to the plan of development adopted in those parts of Borneo
at which our steamer stopped because they throw light upon the
colonial question with which we have to deal. Having described
briefly, but as fully as space permits, the conditions as I found them
in the Philippines, I shall devote the next article to a discussion
of the policy which should be pursued by the United States in regard
to them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<h3>THE PHILIPPINE PROBLEM.</h3>


<p>Having in previous articles discussed the conditions as I found
them in the Philippines, let us consider what the United States should
do in regard to the Filipinos and their islands.</p>

<p>First, as to the northern group of islands&mdash;the islands north of
Mindanao. Have the Filipinos a right to self government? Do they
desire self government and independence? Have they the capacity
for self government?</p>

<p>The first question must be answered in the affirmative if our theory
of government is correct. That governments derive their just powers
from the consent of the governed, is either true or false; if true, we
cannot deny its application to the Filipinos; if false, we must find
some other foundation for our own government.</p>

<p>To the second question I am able to answer, yes. My visit to the
Philippines has settled this question in my own mind. I have heard
people in America affirm that the intelligent Filipinos preferred
American sovereignty to self government, but this is unqualifiedly
false. Captain J. A. Moss, a member of General Corbin's personal
staff, recently made a trip through the provinces of Pampanga, Nueva
Ecija and Pangasinan and published a journal of his trip in one of
the Manila papers upon his return. He concluded his observations
as follows: "The discharged soldiers who are married to native women
and who are 'growing up with the country' and are, therefore, in a
most excellent position to feel the native pulse, all told me the great
majority of the natives have no use for us. Ex-interpreters and other
Filipinos with whom I was on intimate, cordial relations while serving
in the provinces, told me the same thing. I have, therefore, from
the foregoing, come to the conclusion that the Filipinos may be
divided into three classes: (a) The 'precious few,' comprising those
who are really friendly towards the Americans and think our government
beneficial to the islands. (b) Those who are in some way beneficiaries
of the government and entertain for us what may be termed
'expedient friendship.' (c) The great majority, who have absolutely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
no use for us and to please whom we cannot get out of the islands
any too soon."</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="henry" id="henry"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">HENRY C. IDE, GOV. GEN. PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The conclusion drawn by Captain Moss is warranted by the facts,
and the feeling for independence is stronger in Manila, if possible,
than in the provinces. I talked with Filipinos, official and unofficial,
and while they differed in the degree of friendliness which they felt
toward the United States, all expected ultimate independence. The
college students of Manila in the various law schools, medical colleges,
and engineering schools, numbering in all about a thousand, prepared
and presented to me a memorial of more than fifty printed
pages. This was prepared by sub-committees and afterwards discussed,
adopted and signed by the students. It presented an
elaborate review of the economic, industrial and political situation,
viewed from the standpoint of these young men. It criticised certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
acts of the American government thought to be unjust and set forth
arguments in favor of self government and independence&mdash;arguments
so fundamental and so consistent with American ideals that
no American statesman would have publicly disputed them ten years
ago.</p>

<p>The Filipinos point out
that the Americans lack
that sympathy for, and interest
in, the Filipinos necessary
to just legislation,
and this argument is no
reflection upon the good
intentions of Americans.
In fact, good intention is
generally admitted, but
Americans at home recognize,
as do Filipinos here,
that good intentions are
not all that is required. We
have in the United States
men of equal general intelligence
but differing so in
sympathy that no amount
of good intent can keep
one from doing what the
other regards as unjust.
Take for instance, the representative
capitalist and
the average laboring man;
neither would feel that the
other, however well meaning,
was competent to
speak for him.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 250px;"><a name="datu" id="datu"></a>
<img src="images/ill075.jpg" width="250" height="443" alt="datu" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">DATU PIANG AND GRANDSON.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The Filipinos also deny
that the Americans are sufficiently
acquainted with Philippine affairs to legislate wisely. We
also recognize the force of this argument at home, and we leave the
people of each state to act upon their own affairs. The people of a
city would resent interference in their local affairs by the people of
the county although identical in race and language. And they would
resent just as much the attempt of any group of men, however wise, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
direct their government during a temporary residence. How, then, can
congress expect to legislate wisely for people who are not only separated
from America by the widest of the oceans, but differ from the
people of the United States in color, race, history and traditions?
How can a body of men, however benevolent and intelligent, hope by
a few months' residence to so identify themselves with the Filipinos
as to make rules and regulations suited to their needs?</p>

<p>The Filipinos also present an argument against the expensiveness
of American rule, and this argument is not only unanswerable, but
it is directed against an evil which is without remedy. If Americans
are to hold office in the Philippines, they must be well paid. They
must not only receive as much as they would receive in the United
States for the same work, but they must receive more in order to
compensate them for serving so far from home. This is not only
theoretically true, but the theory is exemplified in the pay roll. The
governor general receives $20,000 a year, two-fifths of the salary of the
president of the United States, and yet, what a contrast between the
duties and responsibilities of the two positions! And what a difference,
too, in the wealth of the two countries and in the ability of the
taxpayers of the two countries to pay the salaries!</p>

<p>The three American members of the commission (excluding the
governor general) receive $15,000 per year, almost twice the salary
of cabinet officers and three times the salary of senators and members
of congress. It is true that these salaries do not appear as salaries
paid for work on the commission, but as each American member of
the commission receives $10,000 as head of a department and $5,000
as a member of the commission, his total income is $15,000 while
the Filipino members of the commission receive but $5,000.</p>

<p>The members of the Philippine supreme court receive $10,000 each
(the Filipino members of the court receiving the same as the Americans),
a sum much larger than that usually paid to judges in the
United States in courts of similar importance. This high range of
salaries runs through the entire list of civil officials, and there is no
chance of lowering it. Except in the case of judges, the Filipino
officials, as a rule, receive considerably less than the Americans performing
similar work, and this is a constant source of complaint. To
Americans it is a sufficient answer to say that high salaries are necessary
to secure able and efficient officials from the United States, but
the Filipino is quick to respond, "why, then, do you insist upon sending
us Americans to do what our people could do and would do for
less compensation?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>Not only must the salaries of Americans be high, but Americans
must be surrounded with comforts to which the average Filipino is
not accustomed. No one can remain in the Philippines long without
hearing of the Benguet road and the enormous amount expended in
its construction. There is a mountain resort in Benguet Province, in
north central Luzon, which the commission thought might be developed
into a summer capital or a place to which the families of the
officials, if not the officials themselves, might retreat during the heated
term. The railroad running from Manila to Dagupan would carry
the health-seeker to within thirty or forty miles of Benguet, and an
engineer estimated that a wagon road could be constructed the rest
of the way for $75,000. It seemed worth while to the commission to
appropriate that much for a purpose which promised so much for the
health and comfort of those engaged in the benevolent work of establishing
a stable government. The commission could hardly be blamed
for relying upon the opinion of the engineer, and the engineer doubtless
meant well. But the first appropriation scarcely made an impression,
and the second engineer estimated that the cost would be a
little greater. Having invested $75,000, the commission did not like
to abandon the plan and so further appropriations were made until
more than two millions and a half dollars, gold, have been drained
from the Insular treasury, and the Benguet road is not yet completed.
If it is ever completed, it will require a constant outlay of a large
sum annually to keep it in repair.</p>

<p>Having met the members of the commission and other Americans
residing in the Philippines, I am glad to testify that they are, as a
rule, men of character, ability and standing. The personnel of Philippine
official life is not likely to be improved, and so long as we
occupy the islands under a colonial policy, the Benguet experiment
is liable to be repeated in various forms, and yet the Filipinos point
to the Benguet folly to show that the Americans are both ignorant
of local conditions and partial toward the foreign population.</p>

<p>The third question, are the Filipinos competent to govern themselves?
is the one upon which the decision must finally turn. Americans
will not long deny the fundamental principles upon which our
own government rests, nor will they upon mature reflection assert
that foreigners can sympathize as fully with the Filipino as representatives
chosen by the Filipinos themselves. The expensiveness of
a foreign government and its proneness to misunderstand local needs
will be admitted by those who give the subject any thought, but well-meaning
persons may still delude themselves with the belief that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
Spanish rule has incapacitated the present generation for wisely exercising
the franchise, or that special conditions may unfit the Filipinos
for the establishment and maintenance of as good a government as
can be imposed upon them from without.</p>

</div>

<p>Before visiting the
Philippines, I advocated
independence
on the broad ground
that all people are
capable of self-government&mdash;not
that
all people, if left to
themselves, would
maintain governments
equally good,
or that all people are
capable of participating
upon equal terms
in the maintenance
of the same government,
but that all
people are endowed
by their Creator with
capacity to establish
and maintain a government
suited to
their own needs and
sufficient for their
own requirements.
To deny this proposition
would, as Henry Clay suggested more than half a century ago,
be to impeach the wisdom and benevolence of the Creator. I advocated
independence for another reason, viz., because a refusal to admit the
Filipinos capable of self-government would tend to impair the strength
of the doctrine of self-government when applied to our own people.
Since becoming acquainted with the Filipinos I can argue from observation
as well as from theory, and I insist that the Filipinos are capable
of maintaining a stable government without supervision from without.
I do not mean to say that they could maintain their independence, if
attacked by some great land-grabbing power (it would be easier to
protect them from aggression if they were independent, for then they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
would be interested with us against the attacking party), but that so
far as their own internal affairs are concerned, they do not need to
be subject to any alien government. There is a wide difference, it is
true, between the general intelligence of the educated Filipino and
the intelligence of the laborer on the street and in the field, but this
is not a barrier to self-government. Intelligence controls in every
government, except where it is suppressed by military force. Where
all the people vote, the intelligent man has more influence than the
unintelligent one, and where there is an obvious inequality, a suffrage
qualification usually excludes the more ignorant.</p>

<p>Take the case of the Japanese for instance, no one is disposed to
question their ability to govern themselves, and yet the suffrage qualifications
are such that less than one-tenth of the adult males are
permitted to vote. Nine-tenths of the Japanese have no part in the
law making, either directly or through representatives, and still
Japan is the marvel of the present generation. In Mexico the gap
between the educated classes and the peons is fully as great, if not
greater, than the gap between the extremes of Filipino society, and
yet Mexico is maintaining a stable government, and no party in the
United States advocates our making a colony of Mexico on the theory
that she cannot govern herself.</p>

<p>Those who question the capacity of the Filipinos for self-government
overlook the stimulating influence of self-government upon the
people; they forget that responsibility is an educating influence and
that patriotism raises up persons fitted for the work that needs to be
done. Those who speak contemptuously of the capacity of the Filipinos,
ignore the fact that they were fighting for self-government
before the majority of our people knew where the Philippine islands
were. Two years before our war with Spain, Rizal was put to death
because of his advocacy of larger liberty for his people, and after
witnessing the celebration of the ninth anniversary of his death, I
cannot doubt that his martyrdom would be potent to stir the hearts
of coming generations whenever any government, foreign or domestic,
disregarded the rights of the people.</p>

<p>A year before our war with Spain the Filipino people were in
insurrection against that country, and they demanded among other
things "parliamentary representation, freedom of the press, toleration
of all religious sects, laws common with hers, and administrative and
economic autonomy."</p>

<p>Here was a recognition of the doctrine of self-government and a
recognition of the freedom of the press as the bulwark of liberty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
There was also a demand for freedom of conscience and the right to
administer their own affairs for their own interests. In the proclamation
from which I have quoted there was no demand for independence,
but it must be remembered that we did not demand independence
from England until after we found it was impossible to secure
justice under a colonial system.</p>

<p>Whether by the demand for "laws common with hers" the Filipinos
meant that they wanted the protection of laws made by the Spanish
for themselves, I do not know. If that is the meaning of their
demand, they must be credited with understanding the importance
of a principle to which some of our own public men seem to be blind.
The evil of a colonial policy, the gross injustice of it, arises largely
from the fact that the colony is governed by laws made for it, but
not binding upon the country which makes the laws. The Mexican
who does not participate in the making of the laws of his country has
at least the protection of living under laws which bind the maker
as well as himself. So with the colored man of the south who does
not vote, the laws which he must obey must be obeyed by those who
do vote, and the taxes which he pays must be paid also by those
who enjoy the franchise.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="plowing" id="plowing"></a>
<img src="images/ill077.jpg" width="400" height="228" alt="plowing" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">PLOWING IN SULU LAND.</p></div>
</div>

<p>But under a colonial system the subject must obey a law made for
him by one who is not himself subject to the law. The distinction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
is so plain that it ought to be apparent to anyone upon a moment's
thought.</p>

<p>If it is objected that but a small proportion of the Filipinos are
educated, it may be answered that the number of the educated is
increasing every day. The fact that the Filipinos support the schools
so enthusiastically, even when those schools are established by outsiders
and when the teaching is in a language strange to them, speaks
eloquently in their behalf. Nor is this a new-born zeal. The
Aguinaldo government provided for public schools and, cock fighting
being prohibited, cock pits were actually turned into school houses in
some sections over which the authority of his government extended.</p>

<p>It is objected by some that the intelligent Filipinos would, under
independence, use the instrumentalities of government to tyrannize
over the masses. This is not a new argument; it is always employed
where an excuse for outside interference is desired, but there is no
reason to believe that the Filipinos would be less interested in the
people of their own race and blood than are aliens whose salaries are
so large that it is impossible for them to claim that they serve from
purely altruistic motives.</p>

<p>That those in power in Washington contemplate independence
must be admitted, unless those who speak for the administration intend
gross deception. In his speech on the evening of Rizal Day, December
last, General Smith, one of the Philippine commission and head
of the educational department,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> said: "Popular self-government for
the Philippines is the purpose of both people. If either seeks to
achieve it independent of the other, the experiment is doomed to failure.
If both work for it harmoniously there is no reason why it
should not be accomplished. If it is accomplished, the history of the
Philippines will hold no brighter page than that which recites the
struggle of a simple people to fit themselves for independent government.
If it is accomplished, the fairest page in American history
will be that which records the creation of a new nation and the unselfish
development of an alien race." If this is not a promise of ultimate
independence, what possible meaning can the language have?
If the administration does not intend that the Filipinos shall some
day be independent, its representatives should not hold out this hope.</p>

<p>But there is even higher authority for the hope of independence.
When the so-called "Taft Party" visited the Philippines last summer,
Secretary Taft made a speech in which he assumed to speak for the
president. Referring to the president's opinion, he said: "He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
believes, as I believe and as do most Americans who have had great
familiarity with the facts, that it is absolutely impossible to hope
that the lessons which it is the duty of the United States to teach the
whole Filipino people, can be learned by them, as a body, in less
than a generation; and that the probability is that it will take a
longer period in which to render them capable of establishing and
maintaining a stable independent government."</p>

<p>This, it is true, states when independence cannot be hoped for,
rather than when it can be hoped for, and yet, no honest man would
use the language Secretary Taft employed without having in his mind
the idea that independence would be granted at some future date.
But his concluding words even more clearly present the hope of ultimate
independence, for he says: "All that can be asserted is that
the policy which has several times been authoritatively stated, that
this Filipino government shall be carried on solely for the benefit
of the Filipino people and that self-government shall be extended to
the Filipino people, as speedily as they show themselves fitted to
assume and exercise it, must be pursued consistently by the people of
the United States or else they shall forfeit their honor."</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">SAILING IN MANILA BAY.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Here Secretary Taft pledges the American government as far as
he has power to pledge it&mdash;and he pledges the president also&mdash;to
extend self-government to the Filipinos as rapidly as they show themselves
fitted for it. The great trouble about these utterances and
similar ones is that they are not binding upon the government, and
the Filipinos are constantly disturbed by doubts and fears. Both
at Manila and in the United States ridicule is often cast upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
aspirations of the Filipino people, and plans are made which are
inconsistent with ultimate independence. The attempt on the part
of the commission to issue perpetual franchises is naturally, and I
think rightfully, opposed by all Filipinos. If our occupation is to
be temporary, why should our legislation be permanent? Why bind
the ward in perpetuity so that he cannot control his own affairs when
he reaches years of maturity? What is needed is an immediate
declaration of the nation's purpose to recognize the independence of
the Filipinos when a stable government is established. It is not
necessary that a definite time shall be stated, nor is it so important
just when the Filipinos are to have their independence, as it is that
the nation's purpose shall be made known in an authoritative way
and that the subsequent acts of our government shall be in harmony
with that declaration. I believe that a stable government can be
established within a short time and that independence could be
granted with advantage to our government and with safety to the
Filipinos within five years at the farthest. But whether independence
is to be granted in five or ten or fifteen years or after a longer period,
there should be no longer delay about announcing a policy. I have
tried to impress upon the Filipinos the necessity of leaving this question
to the people of the United States and the importance of proving
in every possible way the virtues, the character and the progress of
the people; I have pointed out the folly of insurrection and the
damage done to their cause by resorting to force of arms, but I am
equally anxious to impress upon my own countrymen the importance
of dealing frankly and fairly with the Filipinos.</p>

<p>We have more at stake in this matter than have the Filipinos.
They still have their national greatness to achieve; our position is
already established. We have the greatest republic known to history;
we are the foremost champion of the doctrine of self-government and
one of the leading exponents of Christianity. We can afford, aye our
honor requires us, to be candid with the Filipinos and to take them
into our confidence. We dare not make them victims of commercial
greed or use their islands for purely selfish purposes. It is high
time to announce a purpose that shall be righteous and to carry
out that purpose by means that shall be honorable. In my next
article I shall endeavor to elaborate a plan which will, in my judgment,
bring independence to the Filipinos, relieve us of the expense
of colonialism, secure us every legitimate advantage which could be
expected from a permanent occupation of the islands and, in addition,
enable our nation to set the world an example in dealing with
tropical races.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<h3>THE PHILIPPINE PROBLEM&mdash;Continued.</h3>


<p>In speaking of the Philippine independence I have presented some
of the reasons given by Filipinos for desiring it, but there are arguments
which ought to appeal especially to Americans. If it were
our duty to maintain a colonial policy, no argument could be made
against it, because duties are imperative and never conflict. If, on
the other hand the Filipinos desire independence and are capable of
self-government, we cannot justify the retention of the islands unless
we are prepared to put our own interests above theirs, and even then
we must be satisfied that our interests will be advanced by a colonial
policy.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the controversy there were many who believed
that the Philippine Islands would become a source of profit to the
United States. It was confidently predicted that a multitude of
Americans would flock to the islands and find rich reward in the
development of their resources. These hopes have not been realized.
Except in Mindanao, of which I shall speak later, there is no evidence
of any present or future colonization by Americans. There are a few
Americans engaged in business in Manila and at other army posts, but
these are insignificant in number and the business done by them is
nothing as compared with the cost of colonialism to the United States.
We are maintaining about twelve thousand American soldiers in the
island and five thousand native scouts, officered by Americans and
paid for by the United States. Besides this outlay for the army,
our Philippine policy has been made the excuse for a large increase
in our naval expenditures. While it is difficult to determine accurately
the annual cost of our Philippine policy to the people of the
United States, it is safe to say that it exceeds the value of all the
merchandise that we export to the Philippine Islands and all the
money made by Americans in the islands, including salaries paid to
Americans from taxes collected in the Philippines&mdash;and the expenses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
are borne by all the people while the benefits are received by a mere
handful. No one, therefore, can justify the holding of the Philippines
on the ground that they are a pecuniary advantage.</p>

<p>If it is argued that we need the Philippine Islands as a base for the
extension of our trade in the Orient, I answer that it is not necessary
to deny the Filipinos independence in order to hold a sufficient number
of harbors and coaling stations to answer all the requirements
of trade. The Filipinos are not only anxious to have the advantage
of our protection, but they recognize that to protect them we must
have harbors and a naval base. In return for the services we have
rendered them we have a right to ask, and they would gladly grant,
such reservations as we need. These reservations could be properly
fortified and would furnish coaling stations both for our navy and for
our merchant marine. It goes without saying that in case we had
war with an oriental nation, it would be infinitely better to have the
Filipinos supporting us, in their own interest as well as out of gratitude,
than to have them awaiting an opportunity for insurrection.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="driver" id="driver"></a>
<img src="images/ill079.jpg" width="400" height="204" alt="driver" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">CARABAO CART AND DRIVER.</p></div>
</div>

<p>I have already referred to the danger which may come to the principle
of self-government in the United States from the systematic
denial of self-government to the Filipinos. As our officials can only
explain their continued presence in the Philippines by alleging incapacity
in the Filipinos, they find themselves unconsciously surrendering
the governmental theories which were until recently universally
accepted in our country. We cannot overlook the influence that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
these changed opinions may have upon the politics of our own country
if a colonial policy is indefinitely continued.</p>

<p>Neither can we ignore the fact that our prestige as a teacher of the
principles of republican government must be impaired if we hold
colonies under the law of force and defend ourselves by using the
arguments employed by kings and emperors as an excuse for denying
self-government to their own people. We cannot preach that governments
derive their just powers from the consent of the governed and
at the same time adopt a different principle in practice.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="cane" id="cane"></a>
<img src="images/ill080.jpg" width="400" height="260" alt="cane" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">HARVESTING SUGAR CANE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It is worth while also to remember that foreign service is more or
less demoralizing to our troops. Our soldiers are good, average men,
but all men are more or less influenced by environment, and our
soldiers cannot be expected to maintain as high a standard of morality
when far away from home and the influences of home, as when
their good purposes are strengthened by the presence of mothers, sisters
and friends. The hospital records show the extent to which our
soldiers yield to the temptations which surround the post, and the
saloons that follow our army speak forcibly of the dangers which
attend foreign service. Can we afford to subject the morals of our
young men to such severe tests unless there is some national gain
commensurate with the loss?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>If our nation would at once declare its intention to treat the Filipinos
living north of Mindanao as it treated the Cubans, and then
proceed, first, to establish a stable government, patterned after our
own; second, to convert that government into a native government
by the substitution of Filipino for American officials as rapidly as
possible; third, to grant independence to the Filipinos, reserving such
harbors and naval stations as may be thought necessary; and, fourth,
to announce its purpose to protect the Filipinos from outside interferences
while they work out their destiny&mdash;if our nation would do
this, it would save a large annual expense, protect its trade interests,
gratify the just ambition of the Filipinos for national existence and
repeat the moral victory won in Cuba.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="harvest" id="harvest"></a>
<img src="images/ill081.jpg" width="400" height="220" alt="harvest" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE RICE HARVEST.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In return for protection from without, the Filipinos would agree,
as the Cubans did, that in their dealings with other nations they
would not embarrass us.</p>

<p>The reservations retained could be converted into centers for the
extension of American influence and American ideals, and our nation
would increase its importance as a real world power. Unless our
religion and our philosophy are entirely wrong, moral forces are
more permanent and, in the end, more potent than physical force,
and our nation has an opportunity to prove that a nation's greatness,
like the greatness of an individual, is measured by service. It also
has an opportunity to prove that the Oriental can be led by advice and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
improved by example and does not need to be coerced by military
power.</p>

<p>Our reservations ought to contain model schools, with a central
college, experimental farms and institutions in which the people could
be trained in the arts and industries most suited to the natural
resources of the country. Our nation is unfitted by history and by
tradition to exploit the tropical countries according to the methods
employed by the monarchies of Europe. To hold people in subjection
requires a large military expenditure; if we were to attempt to
make our own people bear such a burden, they would soon protest;
if we were to make the Filipinos bear it, it would crush them. The
Filipinos would resist such a policy, if employed by us, more bitterly
than if it were employed by a European country, because they have
learned from us the lessons of liberty. Subject peoples are not willing
laborers, and our country would not endorse a system of compulsory
labor. Education, too, is inconsistent with a permanent colonial
system and cannot be carried far without danger to the ruling power.</p>

<p>We must choose, therefore, between two policies, and the sooner
the choice is made, the better. As we cannot adopt the European
policy without a radical departure from our ideals, and ultimately
from our form of government at home, we are virtually forced to
adopt a plan distinctly American&mdash;a plan in which advice, example
and helpfulness shall be employed as means of reaching the native
heart. Some of the European nations have been content to seize land
and develop it with European capital and Chinese labor; our plan
must be to develop the natives themselves by showing them better
methods and by opening before them a wider horizon. At our reservations
there would be religious freedom, freedom of speech, freedom
of the press, self-government and public instruction for all, and
every uplifting influence would have free play. If we believe that
right makes might and that truth has within itself a propagating
power, we cannot doubt the spread of American civilization from
these American centers.</p>

<p>While the Philippine Islands are under American authority, the
government ought to be administered for the benefit of the Filipinos,
in accordance with Secretary Taft's promise. If they are to be subject
to our tariff laws when they buy of other nations, they ought to
have free trade with us, but the Philippine Islands are so far from us
that it would be more just to allow the Philippine tariff to be made by
the Philippine assembly soon to be established. The Filipinos belong to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
the Orient and their dealings must be largely with the countries of
the Orient; unless they are in a position to have their tariff laws conform
to their geographical position, there must necessarily be friction
and injustice.</p>

<p>So important are geographical considerations that Americans who
see fit to take up their residence upon such reservation as we retain for
harbors, coaling stations and a naval base ought to be freed from the
fetters of our tariff laws and shipping laws. I even venture to suggest
the creation of an Oriental territory, to be composed of such stations
and reservations as we may now have or hereafter acquire in
the Orient. This territory should have a delegate in congress like
other territories, but should be freed by constitutional amendment
from our tariff laws and permitted to legislate for itself upon the
subject. It could thus establish free ports, if it chose, and give to its
people the trade advantages enjoyed by those who live in Hong Kong,
Singapore and other open ports.</p>

<p>In what I have said about independence and self-government in
the Philippines, I have been speaking of Luzon and the other islands
north of Mindanao. As I have already pointed out, the conditions
existing in Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago are so different from
those existing in the northern islands that the two groups should be
dealt with separately. It would not be fair to deny independence to
the Christian Filipinos living in the north merely because the Moros
have never shown any desire to adopt a republican form of government.
(They live under a sort of feudal system, with sultan and datu
as the ruling lords.)</p>

<p>But while the work of establishing a stable government among the
Moros is a more difficult one and will proceed more slowly, the same
principles should govern it. The Moros have furnished a great many
pirates for the southern seas, and the influence of the adventurer and
free-booter is still felt in Moroland. Then, too, they have an unpleasant
way of killing Christians, on the theory that by doing so they
not only insure an entrance into heaven, but earn the right to four
wives in their celestial home. Occasionally a Moro takes an oath to
die killing Christians (he is called a juramentado), and after a season
of fasting and prayer, and generally with shaven eyebrows, he goes
forth to slay until he himself is slain. Besides those who deliberately
take human life by retail or by wholesale, there are religious fanatics
who act under frenzy. All in all, the Moro country is far below the
northern islands in civilization whether the civilization is measured
by a material, an intellectual, a political or a moral standard. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
even among the Moros I believe it is possible to introduce American
ideas. Already some progress is being made in the establishment of
schools, and Governor Findley has succeeded in interesting the natives
in exchanges where trade is carried on according to American methods.
While polygamy is still permitted, slavery is being exterminated
and the natives are being shown the advantage of free labor. I believe
that even among them our work can be advanced by assuring them
of ultimate independence, to be granted as soon as a government is
established capable of maintaining order and enforcing law. By
educating young Moros and then using them in official position, we
can convince the Moros of the sincerity of our friendship, and these
officials will exert an increasing influence for good. In the meantime,
we should establish experimental stations and by the use of
native labor train the people to make the best use of the resources of
their country. I believe General Wood is already planning for an
experimental farm near Zamboanga.</p>

<p>While the Moros are a fierce people and accustomed to bloodshed,
they have enough good qualities to show the possibility of improvement.
They are a temperate people, abstaining entirely from intoxicating
liquors, and while they practice polygamy and add concubinage
to plurality of wives, they carefully guard the chastity of their
women. They have their system of laws, with courts for the investigation
of criminal charges and for the imposition of fines. The
existing code in the Sulu archipelago, while lamentably below our
penal code, shows a desire for the establishment of justice between
man and man. Dr. Saleeby has published a translation of the existing
code, together with the code (not yet adopted) prepared by the
present prime minister of the sultan, and a comparison of the two
shows distinctly that American influence is already being felt.</p>

<p>While I do not believe that any large number of Americans can
be induced to settle permanently in Mindanao (and Mindanao seems
to be the most inviting place), there will be ample time to test this
question while a government is being established among the Moros.
It is more likely that the waste lands will be settled upon by immigrants
from the northern islands and that in time the Christian
Filipinos will be sufficiently numerous to control the islands, and
they can then be annexed to the northern group.</p>

<p>The leaven of American ideas is already spreading. At Zamboanga
we met Datu Mandi, who has adopted the American dress and opened
one of his buildings for a Moro school for girls. He is manifesting
an increasing interest in the American work. Datu Mandi's brother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
was one of the Moros taken to the World's Fair and he, too, has
abandoned the native dress. I have already referred to the desire
expressed by Datu Piang to have his sons attend school in America.
This is a good sign, and money spent in educating them would reduce
military expenditures in that part of the island. The sultan of Sulu
also wants to visit America, and a trip would do him more good than
a year's salary. As soon as we convince these people that our purpose
is an unselfish one, they will become willing pupils, and in the course
of time they will find the home more congenial than the harem and
the ways of peace more pleasant than the war path.</p>

<p>While our plans should be unselfish, they would probably prove
profitable in the end, for friends are better customers than enemies,
and our trade is apt to develop in proportion as we teach the natives
to live as we do. When Solomon came to the throne, instead of
choosing riches or long life, he asked for wisdom that he might govern
his people aright, and he received not only wisdom, but the riches
and the length of days which he had regarded as less important. May
we not expect a similar reward if we choose the better part and put
the welfare of the natives above our own gain?</p>

<p>After all, the test question is, have we "faith in the wisdom of
doing right?" Are we willing to trust the conscience and moral sense
of those whom we desire to aid?</p>

<p>Individuals have put Christianity to the test and have convinced
themselves that benevolence, unarmed, is mightier than selfishness
equipped with sword and mail, but nations have as yet seldom ventured
to embody the spirit of the Nazarene in their foreign policy.
Is it not an opportune time for our nation to make the trial? Our
president has recently been hailed as a peacemaker because he took
the initiative in terminating a great war, but this involved no sacrifice
upon our part. May we not win a greater victory by proving our
disinterested concern for the welfare of a people separated from us
not only by vast waters but by race, by language and by color?</p>

<p>Carlyle in concluding his history of the French revolution declared
that thought is stronger than artillery parks and that back of every
great thought is love. This is a lofty platform, but not too lofty for
the United States of America.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<h3>JAVA&mdash;THE BEAUTIFUL.</h3>


<p>We had not thought of visiting Java, but we heard so much of it
from returning tourists as we journeyed through Japan, China and the
Philippines, that we turned aside from Singapore and devoted two
weeks to a trip through the island. Steamers run to both Batavia
(which is the capital and the metropolis of the western end of the island)
and Soerabaja, the chief city of eastern Java, and a railroad
about four hundred miles long connects these two cities. A tour of the
islands can thus be made in from ten to fifteen days, according to connections,
but unless one is pressed for time, he can profitably employ
a month or more in this little island, attractive by nature and made
still more beautiful by the hand of man. There are excellent hotels
at the principal stopping places, and the rates are more moderate than
we have found elsewhere in the Orient.</p>

<p>The lover of mountain scenery finds much in Java to satisfy the eye.
The railroad from Batavia to Soerabaja twice crosses the range, and as
the trains run only in the day time, one can, without leaving the cars,
see every variety of tropical growth, from swamp to mountain top,
from cocoanut groves and rice fields on the low land to the tea gardens
and coffee plantations of the higher altitudes, not to speak of mountain
streams, gorges and forests.</p>

<p>Java is the home of the volcano and contains more of these fiery reservoirs
than any other area on the earth's surface. While only about six
hundred miles in length and from sixty to a hundred and twenty miles
in width, it has, according to Wallace, thirty-eight volcanoes, some of
them still smoking and all of them interesting relics of a period when
the whole island was deluged with molten lava. Some assert that almost
all of Java has been built up by the eruptions of volcanoes. Two extinct
volcanoes, Salak and Gedah, can be seen from Buitenzorg, and from the
top of Boro Boedoer temple nine volcanoes can be counted when the air
is clear&mdash;at least Groneman so declares in his description of this temple,
although not so many were visible the day we visited there.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><a name="driveway" id="driveway"></a>
<img src="images/ill082.jpg" width="600" height="349" alt="driveway" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">A DRIVEWAY IN BOTANICAL GARDEN&mdash;BUITENZORG</p></div>
</div>

<p>It is only twenty-three years ago that Krakatau, which stands upon
an island of the same name in the Strait of Sunda, just off the east
end of Java, startled the world with an eruption seldom equaled in history.
It began smoking in May, 1883, and continued active until the
26th of August following, when explosions took place which were
heard at Batavia, eighty miles distant, and the next day the explosions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a><br /><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
were still more gigantic, being audible two thousand miles away. The
loss of life caused by the mud and ashes and by the waves set in motion
by the eruption was officially estimated at over thirty-six thousand.
Various scientific societies, especially of Holland, England and France,
made exhaustive reports on the Krakatau eruption. The Royal Society
of Great Britain estimated that the volume of smoke arose to a height
of seventeen miles and that several cubic miles of mud, lava and stones
poured forth from the crater to the ruin of a large area. At one place
the water rose more than seventy-five feet and threw a steamship over
the harbor-head into a Chinese market; but under the influence of a
tropical sun and abundant moisture the slopes of the volcano soon grew
green again, and now the natives speed their skiffs through the adjacent
waters and the inhabitants of this volcanic belt live and move
with little thought of the mighty forces which have so often demonstrated
their powers in the archipelago.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="extinct" id="extinct"></a>
<img src="images/ill083.jpg" width="400" height="207" alt="extinct" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">EXTINCT VOLCANO, SALAK</p></div>
</div>

<p>If one is interested in the study of trees, plants and flowers he can
employ himself indefinitely in the famous botanical garden in Buitenzorg.
While Batavia is the normal capital of Netherlands India, the
governor general lives at Buitenzorg&mdash;a city built on a mountain slope
forty miles from Batavia, where an altitude of some seven hundred feet
gives an average temperature of eight degrees below that of the sea
level. The botanical garden surrounds the palace and for nearly a century
the authorities have been collecting specimens of the flora of the
tropics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>The present superintendent of the garden, Herr Wigman, is an
enthusiast in his line, and we are indebted to him for a most enjoyable
tour through the garden. The main entrance leads through an avenue
of gigantic kanari trees, set some forty feet apart and forming a verdant
roof that entirely excludes the sun. The officials believe that they have
made this the most attractive driveway in the world, and so far as my
observation goes, they are justified in their claim. Climbing vines of
every variety have been trained upon these trees until their enormous
trunks stand like so many columns draped in living green. One climbing
vine, with a trunk which one would mistake for a tree if it stood
alone, has festooned a row of trees three hundred feet long and is still
reaching out for new conquests. Herr Wigman shows this monster vine
with pardonable pride, but he has found on his visits to Europe that he
could not give a truthful description of it without endangering his reputation
for veracity. We saw, here, also, rattan vines of seemingly endless
length, hanging from lofty limbs or coiling on the ground like a
colony of serpents. A specialty has been made of orchids, as is evidenced
by a collection of between two and three thousand varieties.
Some of these are remarkable for their curious and variegated leaves,
others for the beauty and delicacy of the flowers. We were shown three
kinds of pitcher plants; one kind is fashioned like a rat trap, the tiny
spines pointing downward so that the insect can enter but can not
escape until the flower withers; another drowns his victims in a syrup-like
water; while a third poisons the unlucky prisoners lured into the
recesses of the blossoms. Several plants growing on tree trunks have
porous bulbs which seem to be designed for ant houses; at any rate the
ants are always found in them. By an admirable reciprocity the ants
pay their house rent by protecting the plants from other insects. Some
of the European nations have defended their occupation of Oriental
countries on the same theory, viz., that they give protection in exchange
for a domicile, but there is no evidence that the ant lives on the plant,
while colonialism is always a burden to the natives.</p>

<p>In the botanical garden, as elsewhere in the island, are to be found
all varieties of the palm&mdash;the royal palm, than which there is no more
ornamental tree, the cocoanut palm, with its myriad uses, the sugar
palm, the sago palm, the oil palm, the betel-nut palm, which furnishes
the Malay a substitute for chewing tobacco, the nipa palm, so helpful
in building, the fan palm, etc., etc.</p>

<p>Nature has been prodigal in her gifts to the people of the tropics, and
besides giving plant life in confusing abundance, her generosity is
shown in a number of trees, each of which can be put to many uses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
Reference was made to the bamboo in one of the articles on Japan, but
the Javanese have not only the bamboo, but the palm as well, and
from this one tree they could build their houses (though the bamboo
is usually used for frames and floors because it is lighter, the trunk
of the palm might be employed) and secure food, drink and light, and
in addition, a fermented liquor and a narcotic.</p>

<p>The lakes and pools of the Buitenzorg garden teem with lotus and
water lilies of many colors. One variety, brought from New Guinea,
has blue flowers of various shades and is as yet unknown in Europe and
America. One water lily has enormous flat, circular leaves with the
edges turned up like a pie pan. Some of these leaves are four feet in
diameter, and an imaginative writer has pictured them as frying pans
on which the natives bake hot cakes.</p>

<p>The papyrus, from which the ancient Egyptians made their paper,
grows here, though it is no longer found in Egypt. Here, too, are flowering
trees and shrubs of many kinds, one whose pods are so exactly
like tallow candles that it is called the candle tree. But it would
occupy more space than I have at my disposal to give an adequate
description of the beauties of the garden, with its mighty banyan trees,
its waving palms, its graceful bamboos, its odorous sandalwood and
tangled vines, its rose garden, its depth of shade and wealth of bloom,
its upas tree (not deadly, however, as tradition has it, but quite innocent
of any criminal intent), its winding ways and really moss-grown
paths and its secluded little cemetery where rest those members of
the families of the governors who died on the island. No wonder
Buitenzorg is the Mecca of the botanist and the one spot never neglected
by even the casual tourist in the island.</p>

<p>Java reminds one of Japan in the appearance of its rice fields, its
cultivated hills and its terraced mountain sides. Though the island is
diminutive in area, containing a little less than forty thousand square
miles, half of which is tillable, the land is so wisely used that it supports
a population of 28,000,000. With so many mountains and
with a rainfall amounting to ten feet per annum in some places; the
island has, as might be expected, an abundance of springs and running
streams, and these make possible a very perfect system of irrigation
which has converted Java into a vast garden. Sugar is the chief export,
followed by tea, coffee and copra, although rice is the product to which
most attention is given. It is the chief article of food, and so much is
required to support the dense population that its importance as a crop
is not indicated by its place in the table of exports.</p>

<p>As a traveler is more impressed by the unusual things than by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a><br /><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
things with which he is familiar, one who visits Java immediately
notices the numerous fruits peculiar to the island. They have here all
of the fruits usually found in tropical countries and several that are
not found elsewhere. The pineapple grows in perfection and can be
bought in the market for about a cent apiece. The Java orange is not
equal in taste or variety to those of California or Florida, but the
banana, of which there are more than a hundred varieties, makes up
for the deficiency. Mrs. Scidmore, in her book on Java, is authority
for the statement that four thousand pounds of bananas will grow on
the space required to produce ninety-nine pounds of potatoes or thirty-three
pounds of wheat; if her calculation is correct and the ratio of
productiveness anything like the same in the case of other fruit, one
can understand why the problem of living is so simplified in warm
countries. A fruit closely allied to our grape-fruit is found here, a variety
of which grows in China and Japan. The papaya, which we first
tasted in Honolulu, the mango, whose season had passed in the Philippines,
the sour manila and the durian are all to be bought in the
market here. The last named fruit has succeeded in arraying into
ardent friends and unsparing critics the tourists who have ventured to
eat it. Some declare that it is delicious, while others can not bear the
taste, and all agree that the odor is exceedingly repulsive. It is rough-skinned,
very large, sometimes weighing ten or fifteen pounds, and
resembles in appearance both the bread fruit and the nangka.</p>

<p>Among the fruits which we have tasted for the first time the mangosteen
and the rambutan are rivals in popularity. The first is a delicately
flavored, orange-shaped morsel of pure white, encased in a thick
hull of deep red. It melts in the mouth, and leaves a memory of
mingled flavors. Its fame has spread abroad, and there was for years a
standing offer of thirty pounds to anyone who would put Queen Victoria
in possession of a ripe mangosteen, but it decays so quickly that
not even ice will preserve it during a long sea voyage. The rambutan
has not received as much praise as the mangosteen, but I am not sure
but that it is superior for continuous use. The word rambutan means
hairy, and the name was given to this fruit because it has a covering
something like a chestnut burr, except that the so-called hairs are soft
instead of spine-like. There is a variety of rambutan which has a
smoother covering without the hair-like projections, and this is very
appropriately called the kapoelassen (which means bald) rambutan.
The usual color of the covering is a bright crimson, but there are several
different shades, and the trees present a very attractive appearance
when laden with ripe fruit. The pulp of the rambutan resembles a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
pigeon's egg in size and shape and contains a single seed. The flavor
is half tart, half sweet, and recalls all the good things one has ever
tasted.</p>

<p>Another Javanese fruit is the doekoe, which on the outside looks like
an apricot, but is divided into sections like an orange and has a taste
peculiarly its own. The jamboa, or Java apple, is conical in shape and
has a white wax appearance. But enough has been said to indicate the
variety of fruits exposed for sale on the street and peddled at railway
stations. The natives usually carry an assortment of fruit as they go
to or return from market, and the floor of the third-class railroad
coaches are always littered with rinds and peelings. Verily, one can
revel in fruit to his heart's content in Java.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting days that we spent in Java was devoted
to a trip to Boro Boedoer, the great Hindu temple near Djokjakarta.
Leaving the through train at this station with the jaw-breaking name,
we went by tram line about twenty miles and then drove six miles
farther. Near the temple the road crosses a ferry, the substantial bridge
which once spanned the river there having been swept away, and when
we reached this point we found the stream so swollen by recent rains
that the natives were not willing to risk their boats in the angry
flood. We returned to the tramway station and spent the night in the
hospitable home of the Dutch stationmaster, the only white man in the
town. Returning to the river early next morning we found that the
waters had sufficiently subsided to enable us to cross, and we reached
Boro Boedoer while yet the sun was low. And what a monument is
Boro Boedoer to the zeal of the Buddhist priests, the skill of the Hindu
architect and the patient industry of the Javanese! As a temple it is
not surpassed, in labor expended upon its construction it is comparable
with the pyramids, and in artistic skill displayed in design and execution,
it is even superior to them.</p>

<p>According to archæologists, it was built about twelve hundred years
ago when the Javanese were worshipers of Buddha, but the invasion of
the Mohammedans of the fifteenth century was so complete that that
stupendous pile was first neglected, then deserted and at last forgotten.
It was so overgrown with trees and shrubbery that the Dutch traders
were in the country for two centuries before its presence was discovered.
When it was found and unearthed during the occupancy of the
English under Sir Stamford Raffles in 1814, the people living in the
vicinity were as much surprised as the foreigners, for all tradition of its
existence had been lost. This seems hardly possible when it is remembered
that the temple stands upon the summit of a mound, is five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a><br /><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
hundred feet square at the base and towers to the height of a hundred
feet. The structure is pyramidal in form and rises in eight terraces,
the first five being square and the last three circular. Each terrace has
a wall at the outer edge, which with the wall of the next succeeding
terrace forms a roofless gallery, either side of which is ornamented
with bas reliefs descriptive of the life of Buddha. These carvings, if
placed side by side, would, it is estimated, extend for three miles, and
the story which they tell has been interpreted by eminent archæologists
who have visited the place. These pictures in stone not only
portray the rise and development of the great Indian teacher, but they
preserve a record of the dress and customs of the people, the arms and
implements used, and the fauna and flora of that time.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><a name="temple" id="temple"></a>
<img src="images/ill085.jpg" width="600" height="345" alt="temple" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">TEMPLE AT BORO BOEDOER</p></div>
</div>

<p>At the center of each side there is a covered stairway leading to the
summit, and there is evidence that the galleries were once separated
from each other by doors. In the niches along the gallery walls there
are four hundred and thirty-two stone images of Buddha, life size and
seated on the ever present lotus. On the three circular terraces there are
seventy-two openwork, bell-shaped structures, called dagabas, each containing
a stone image of Buddha. Surmounting the temple is a great
dagaba fifty feet in diameter and in it was found an unfinished statue
of Buddha similar to those found on the various galleries.</p>

<p>As the stone employed in the construction of the temple was of a
hard variety the bas reliefs are well preserved. No mortar was used for
cementing the stones and no columns or pillars were employed.</p>

<p>Besides Boro Boedoer there are hundreds of other temples scattered
over the island. Within two miles of the elevation upon which the
great temple stands there are two religious edifices&mdash;one a shrine of
exquisite proportions, restored in 1904, and another a temple of considerable
size now being restored. At Brambanan, about twenty miles
east of Djokjakarta, there is a large group of temples scarcely less
interesting than Boro Boedoer. One of the reports received by Sir
Stamford Raffles describes this territory as the headquarters of Hinduism
in Java and the temples as "stupendous and finished specimens
of human labor and of the science and taste of ages long since forgot."</p>

<p>I must reserve for another article my observations upon the people
and upon Dutch rule of the island and will conclude this paper with
the suggestion that Java should be included in a tour of the world,
whether undertaken for instruction or pleasure, for few sections of the
earth have been so blessed by the Creator's bounty, so beautified by the
skill of the husbandman, or are so rich in ruins.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<h3>NETHERLANDS INDIA.</h3>


<p>As the Dutch have administered in what they call Netherlands
India, a colonial system quite different in its methods from the systems
adopted by other nations, I have thought it worth while to make some
inquiries concerning it.</p>

<p>The Malay archipelago, which might almost be described as a
continent cut up into islands, has furnished a farm on which several nations
have experimented in colonialism, but the Dutch, both in length
of occupancy and in the number of people subjected to their rule, are
easily first. The archipelago is more than four thousand miles long
from east to west, and if the Philippine Islands are included, thirteen
hundred miles wide. Some of the islands are larger than European
states; Borneo and New Guinea each have an area greater than the British
Isles. On the map the islands of the archipelago look like stepping
stones connecting Asia with Australia, but some writers, arguing from
the fauna and flora as well as from the depths of the surrounding
waters, contend that the western islands are an extension of Asia and
the eastern ones an extension of Australia. Alfred Russell Wallace,
for instance, points out that the animals, birds and natural products of
the two sections differ so much as to suggest that one group is much
older than the other.</p>

<p>This archipelago is the home of one of the branches into which the
human family is divided, viz., the Malay or brown race. These people
are distinct in appearance, and in many of their characteristics,
from the yellow and black races as well as from the white race. There
are in some of the islands remnants of aboriginal tribes, but the
Malays from time immemorial have furnished the prevailing type.
They have shown themselves capable of continuous and systematic
labor where they have been subjected to coercion, or where
a sufficient inducement has been presented as a stimulus; but the
depressing influence of a continuous summer, added to the bounty of
the tropics, has naturally made them less industrious than those who
live in the temperate zone. The clothing required by the Malay is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
insignificant in amount and value. The little children are bare and
seem to enjoy a shower as much as ducks do. In Sourabaya, the second
city in Java, we saw a group of them naked, sliding on their stomachs
on a marble floor of an open porch during a heavy rain. This seemed
a fairly satisfactory substitute for the ice ponds of the north.</p>

<p>The adults, both men and women, wear a sarong (except when the
men content themselves with a
breech cloth). The sarong, a simple
strip of cloth, is draped about
the figure with all the fullness in
front and fastened in some mysterious
way without the aid of buttons,
hooks or pins. This garment, if garment
it may be called, gives opportunity
for the exercise of taste, and
the range in price is sufficient to permit
of some extravagance in dress.
The best native sarongs are more expensive
than silk, the cloth being
overlaid with wax, upon which the
pattern is traced, and the dyes applied
by hand. The masses use a
cheap cotton print manufactured in
Europe. One of the striking peculiarities
of Javanese life is the adoption
of the sarong by the European
women for morning wear. Ladies
who appear at dinner in full evening
dress may be seen on the balconies
and streets in the morning hours clad
in loose hanging sarongs and thin
dressing sacques, their bare feet encased
in sandals. On the Dutch boat
upon which we left Batavia we saw
posted notices designating the hours
during which the sarong could be worn, and giving permission to men
to wear a pajama-like outfit during the same hours.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 249px;"><a name="native" id="native"></a>
<img src="images/ill086.jpg" width="249" height="565" alt="native" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">A NATIVE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The Malay women wear no hats, but the men usually wear a turban,
the tying of which is a great perplexity to the foreigner.</p>

<p>The natives of the Malay Islands appear to be a mild mannered
and peaceful people, although fighting tribes have been encountered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
in the mountain regions, the suppression of which has cost the Dutch
many lives and a large outlay of florins. In Sumatra there are sections
that have never been subdued.</p>

<p>The Chinaman is to be found throughout the archipelago; in fact,
he far outstrips all other foreign elements. The population of Java
is given as 28,747,000 in the government statistics, and of this total
277,000 are Chinese. The number of Europeans is given as 62,477,
and the number of Arabs at 18,000, while a little more than three
thousand come from other Asiatic countries. I was informed that
the 62,000 described as Europeans included the half castes who
number more than 40,000, the number of real Europeans being
about 20,000. In the other islands controlled by Holland, the population
is given at a little more than five and a half millions, and the
number of Chinese at 260,000, while the European population is estimated
at 13,000, the Arabs at 9,000, and other Asiatics at 13,000. It
will be seen from these figures that the Chinese form the chief foreign
ingredient in Netherlands India, as they do in Borneo and the
Straits Settlements. In Java, where we had a chance to observe
them, we found that the Chinese monopolized the mercantile
business except where they were compelled to share it with
Arabs and Indians. We also heard of them as money lenders,
the rate of interest being generally usurious. It may be said
to their credit, however, that as Shylocks the Arabs can surpass them.
The superiority of the Arab in this respect has given rise to the saying
among the natives that the Chinaman leaves a native with nothing
but a sarong while an Arab strips him bare. Many Chinamen
have grown rich and have permanently identified themselves with
the country, and of these some have discarded the queue entirely
while others have retained it in a diminutive form, a little wisp of
hair lengthened out with silk thread and growing from a spot not
much larger than a dollar.</p>

<p>Apropos of the Chinese agitation against our exclusion act, it is
interesting to know that the Chinese born in Java presented a petition
to the governor general a few years ago asking for the restriction
of the further immigration of Chinese coolies. The petition was
not granted, but the leader of the movement so aroused the wrath of
the coolies that they called upon him in a body and pelted his house
with mud.</p>

<p>In all of the Malay states the opium vice is turned to account by the
rulers. In some places the sale of opium is a government monopoly,
while in others it is farmed out to the highest bidder. In North Borneo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
there is a district called Sarawak owned and ruled by an Englishman
who is known as Rajah Brooke. When we were passing
through Singapore, I noticed in a morning paper an advertisement
wherein the Sarawak government asked for bids for a three years'
lease of the "opium farm," "gambling farm," and "arrack farm"
(arrack is the native name for an intoxicating liquor). In all of the
archipelago the vices of the people seem to be as remunerative to the
government as their virtues, and I was reminded of the Chinese official
at Pekin who jokingly informed me that he had a selfish reason
for opposing the boycott of American goods, because it would deprive
him of American cigarettes, of which he was very fond.</p>

<p>The Dutch traders followed the Portuguese into the East Indies,
and in time supplanted them. Holland then chartered the East
India Trading Company and Amsterdam became the spice center
from which all Europe drew its supplies. The Dutch Trading Company
was manned by a thrifty crew, and it was not long before they
conceived of monopolizing the world's spice market, and they accomplished
this by destroying groves and prohibiting competition by
treaty with the natives. They are also charged with destroying spice
by the ton in Amsterdam in order to maintain the price. One apologist
for this almost universally condemned practice of the Dutch, says:</p>

<p>"When the Dutch established their influence in these seas and relieved
the native princes from their Portuguese oppressors, they saw
that the easiest way to repay themselves would be to get this spice
trade into their own hands. For this purpose they adopted the wise
principle of concentrating the culture of these valuable products in
those spots of which they could have complete control. To do this
effectually, it was necessary to abolish the culture and trade in all
other places, which they succeeded in doing by treaty with the native
rulers. These agreed to have all the spice trees in their possessions
destroyed. They gave up large, though fluctuating, revenues, but
they gained in return a fixed subsidy, freedom from the constant attacks
and harsh oppression of the Portuguese, and a continuance of
their regal power and exclusive authority over their own subjects,
which has maintained in all the islands except Ternate to this day. It
is no doubt supposed by most Englishmen, who have been accustomed
to look upon this act of the Dutch with vague horror, as something
utterly unprincipled and barbarous, that the native population
suffered grievously by this destruction of such valuable property.
But it is certain that this is not the case."</p>

<p>He then proceeds to charge that the native sultans had a "rigid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a><br /><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
monopoly" of the spice trade before the Dutch arrived, and that the
latter by prohibiting the cultivation of spices left the natives more
time for the production of food and other salable things, and concludes:
"I believe, therefore, that this abolition of the spice trade in
the Moluccas was actually beneficial to the inhabitants, and that it
was an act both wise in itself and morally and politically justifiable."</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><a name="javanese" id="javanese"></a>
<img src="images/ill087.jpg" width="600" height="350" alt="javanese" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">A GROUP OF JAVANESE</p></div>
</div>

<p>It will be noticed that in a very brief space he employs the arguments
mainly relied upon to support monopoly wherever it has appeared,
and also for colonialism in its worst forms. In the first place,
the Dutch had to "repay themselves" for having "relieved the native
princes from their Portuguese oppressors"&mdash;that is, they had to collect
pay for their philanthropy; second, as the sultans were doing the
same thing, the Dutch might as well do it&mdash;that is, the very familiar
argument, "If we don't do it, somebody else will;" and third, it was
a good thing for the natives&mdash;it is never difficult to prove this to the
man who profits by the system. But nothing is said as to the effect
of the monopoly upon consumers of spices throughout the world. It
does not seem to occur to the writer above quoted (Wallace) that they
are to be considered. The view point from which he looks at the
whole matter can be judged from his admonition to the British that
they must not be too much "afraid of the cry of despotism and slavery"
if they are to improve their "rude subjects" and raise them up
toward their own level.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the Dutch East India
Company became involved and turned its possessions over to the
crown of Holland, since which time Netherlands India has been a
crown colony. There was a brief interim of British rule (1811 to
1816), but at the close of the Napoleonic wars the Dutch regained
their possessions by treaty, and the English congratulated themselves
that they had been relieved of a burden.</p>

<p>The Dutch have governed Java through the natives, a resident acting
as "elder brother" to the Javanese ruler. While the native government
has not been disturbed, and while the native ruler is protected
from rival claimants, he is really a prisoner in his own castle,
and can not leave the premises without permission. However, as
these native rulers receive good salaries and are allowed to exact homage
from their subjects, they seem quite content with their lot, and
the people, naturally docile, yield obedience to the chiefs of their own
race.</p>

<p>The culture system, aside from the indirect method of ruling, is the
distinguishing feature of Dutch colonialism as it existed until recent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
years. The East India Company followed the practice of the native
princes and collected a land tax or rent of one-fifth the crop, and required
in addition the labor of all able-bodied males for one day in
five. During the five years of British rule, forced labor was abolished
and a land tax substituted for the one-fifth rent, while a separate
property system was encouraged. As soon as the Dutch resumed control,
they went back to their old régime except that they demanded
one day's labor in seven instead of one day in five. By regulating
the crops to be planted, by collecting the fifth of the produce of the
land and by compelling the peasants to plant one-fifth of the village
land in crops to be sold to the government at a fixed price far below
the market price, the government of Holland derived large revenues
from its India possessions. It has been estimated that in fifty years
a sum exceeding three hundred million dollars was exacted from the
natives in forced labor and in the sale of produce below the market
price. As might be expected, the greed which manifested itself in
the conduct of the government aroused increasing criticism, and the
authorities were at last compelled to change their methods.</p>

<p>Those who travel through Java are unanimous in their praise of
the beautiful roads and the substantial bridges that span the streams:
they admire the commodious plantation homes, the splendid tea and
coffee farms and the well built and well kept cities, and they are inclined
to excuse the means employed by the foreigners in the development
of the islands. It must be remembered, however, that the rice
fields, which are most attractive, existed before the Europeans set foot
upon the soil and that the spices, instead of being introduced by the
Dutch, were the products which first attracted their attention. The
Dutch have charged a high price for the services rendered, and have
given little attention to the intellectual and moral improvement of the
people. Being surprised that the Javanese had a well developed system
of agriculture and irrigation before the Europeans arrived, I
asked an intelligent Hollander: "What, then, have the Dutch taught
the Javanese?" and he replied laughingly, "We have taught them to
pay us their money."</p>

<p>The fact that the culture system has, after full discussion, been
abandoned is a sufficient condemnation of it, and the fact that reforms
are being introduced is a confession that they were needed. I
had the pleasure of meeting the present governor, General Van
Heutsz, and found him interested in enlarging the educational system,
and in lightening the burdens upon the people. He has already
reduced the labor requirement one half, so that the natives now give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
one day in fourteen to the government instead of one day in seven.</p>

<p>The governor of Netherlands India receives the same salary as our
president, and the resident receives a salary which, including allowances,
amounts to nearly ten thousand dollars. The expenses of the
colonial government are paid by the natives and by the foreigners
residing there, but the government of Holland no longer draws an
income from the islands. Her advantages are at present indirect
ones and consist, first of profits earned by her citizens in trade with
the islands; second, of rents collected by her citizens from plantations;
and third, of salaries drawn by her citizens for civil or military
service in the islands.</p>

<p>Formerly land was sold to foreigners, but for a great many years it
has been the policy of the government to sell no land whatever to
either Europeans or Asiatics, but to lease it for seventy-five years or
less. I was surprised to find that the natives own considerably more
than twice as much as foreigners hold under lease or deed, and that
land, the product of which must be sold to the government at a fixed
price, has been reduced to 300,000 acres.</p>

<p>One of the beneficent reforms about to be inaugurated is the establishment
of government pawnshops, which will loan money to the
people at a low rate of interest, and thus rescue them from the extortion
which has been practiced upon them. The government has
already established savings banks in which the deposits are constantly
increasing.</p>

<p>There is a growing demand in Java for a greater recognition of the
people in government, and this demand is being yielded to in the cities.
The colonial authorities have encouraged the soldiers to marry native
women, these marriages terminating when the soldiers return to
Europe. As a result, there is a half caste element which has been
given better educational advantages than are accorded to the natives.
This element considers itself as native, although counted in the census
as European, and is already organizing with a view of securing
more civil liberty.</p>

<p>Whatever may be said of Dutch colonialism in the past, a new era
is dawning, and the present rulers recognize that their administration
must be measured by the improvement in the people rather than by
the profits drained from the land by Europeans.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<h3>IN THE TROPICS.</h3>


<p>In a tour around the world one travels by steamer about six thousand
miles through the tropics. Entering the torrid zone soon after
leaving Hong Kong, almost touching the equator at Singapore, and
not entering the temperate zone again until he is nearly half way
through the Red Sea, he has ample time to study the temperature;
and our opportunities were still farther enlarged by the trip to Java,
which carried us nearly eight degrees below the equator. While on
the water the heat is not so noticeable, being relieved by the ocean
breezes, on land one suffers during the middle of the day. It is not
that the heat in the shade is greater than the summer heat in the
United States, but one can not always be in the shade, and the rays of
the sun are piercing to a degree which is inconceivable to one without
experience in these latitudes. At the seaports, too, the heat is intensified
by the weight and moisture of the air, and the temperature is
practically the same the year round&mdash;at least one who visits this part
of the world in the winter time can not imagine it worse.</p>

<p>While, the native population work barebacked, barelegged, barefooted,
and sometimes bareheaded, Americans and Europeans resort
to every possible device to protect them from the climate.</p>

<p>The white helmet, with a lining of cork, is the most common headwear
for both men and women, and it does not require a very long
stay here to convince one that it is superior to the straw hat. White
clothes which reflect the rays of the sun are also largely worn by both
sexes. For evening dress, men sometimes wear a close-fitting white
jacket, reaching to the waist, and before breakfast they lounge about
in pajamas of variegated colors.</p>

<p>Eating extends through the entire day. Tea or coffee can be had
from five to eight; breakfast is ready at eight or nine and ends at
twelve; lunch or tiffin as it is called here, occupies the hours from one
to three; then tea follows at four, and dinner is served from eight to
ten-thirty. These are the hours for Europeans and Americans, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
for those natives who have adopted foreign ways, but most of the
natives look as if they had missed some of these meals.</p>

<p>We are among the dark-skinned races here. Chinamen are a
darker yellow than those seen farther north, the Malays are a dark
brown and Tamils are quite black, while the Singalese and Indians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
are between a black and brown. Mark Twain pays a high compliment
to these dark-skinned people at the expense of the white races,
contending that their complexion is always good, while the white face
has freckles, pimples and moles to mar it.</p>

<p>There are two great seaports near the equator which every traveler
visits, viz.: Singapore and Colombo, and most of the boats also stop
at Penang, a thriving city on the Malay peninsula, some four hundred
miles north of Singapore. Singapore is on a small island of
the same name not far from the mainland, and its harbor is full of
sea-going vessels of all nations. The ships from Europe to China
and Japan call here, as do also the boats between Europe and Java
and between India and Australia. Here, too, are to be found representatives
of many nationalities, twenty-nine distinct languages being
spoken in this one city. The Portuguese were the pioneers, and there
are still some descendants of the early traders living on the island.
Next in point of time came the Dutch, and their nation is still more
numerously represented among the business firms. England, however,
though a later arrival, has largely supplanted both in the control
of the commerce of the port, though the Germans seem to be
numerous.</p>

<p>Singapore and Penang are the great export ports for tin, three-fourths
of the world's output for that product being mined near by.
The United States takes ten and a half million dollars of tin from
the Straits Settlements and six millions of other products and sells
only $1,161,000 worth in return.</p>

<p>I might add in this connection that the trade possibilities of the
tropics have been very much overestimated by enthusiastic expansionists.
The natives raise their own food at a much lower cost than
we could possibly sell it to them, even if our food were suited to their
wants. They do not need our building material, and as for clothing,
one American is worth more as a customer than a hundred of these
natives. While a few wear rich robes, the mass content themselves
with a very scanty costume of very cheap cotton&mdash;a costume which
someone has described as "a handkerchief around the loins and a
table cloth around the head." No shoe manufacturer need send a
salesman to these parts, for even the coachman and footmen in livery
are barefooted. I once supposed that we might work up a trade in
breech clouts and fishing rods, but I find the latter grow here in profusion,
and the former are not valuable enough to furnish a basis for
much trade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>There is one branch of commerce that might be developed if this
were not the home of the gem and if the natives were not skillful
goldsmiths. Jewelry is the passion here. Women fairly load themselves
down with ornaments when they can afford it. They wear
rings on the fingers and toes, bracelets and anklets, ear ornaments
galore and, strangest of all, jewels in the nose. We noticed one
woman yesterday with three enormous pendants hanging from each
ear, one from the top, one from the side and one from the lobe, and
our coachman at Kandy was resplendent with six in either ear, but
his jewelry was more modest in size. The nose ornaments look like
shirt studs and are screwed into one or both nostrils; sometimes a ring
hangs from the point of the nose. The necklaces vary greatly in
style, workmanship and value. The island of Ceylon is rich in gems
and furnishes a variety of stones for the jeweler's art. From the fact
that nearly all of the precious stones mentioned in the Bible are to
be found here it is thought that Ceylon must have been known to the
Israelites and that her ships carried wealth to Solomon.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="kandy" id="kandy"></a>
<img src="images/ill089.jpg" width="400" height="253" alt="kandy" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE LAKE AT KANDY, CEYLON.</p></div>
</div>

<p>After seeing the extravagant use of jewelry here, one is almost
tempted to forgive even the most vulgar display of precious stones
made in the Occident; and then, too, the rubies, sapphires, the diamonds,
the emeralds, the amethysts, the alexanderites, the cat's eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
the opals, etc., exhibited in the stores here are so beautiful that one
must be proof against vanity to resist their charms.</p>

<p>Ice might have formed an important item of trade, for nowhere
does the white man appreciate this luxury more, had not the ice
machine made importation unnecessary. The larger boats now manufacture
their own ice from condensed sea water, and there are plants
at all the important ports. We went from Borneo to Singapore on a
ship which was not equipped with an ice machine, and we complained
when the supply gave out. An English passenger took advantage of
our distress to compare national characteristics, and humorously
remarked that when the Americans moved into a new territory, they
at once established an ice plant, while the English gave their first
attention to the laying out of cricket grounds.</p>

<p>One does not travel far in the Orient until he becomes a crank on
the subject of water. He receives so many warnings that he soon suspects
that disease lurks in every glassful. If he tries the bottled
waters, they pall on the taste, and if he relies on boiled water he is
tormented with fear that it has not really been boiled or that some
other water has been accidentally substituted. "The Old Oaken
Bucket" is recalled as a vision of delight, and "the well at home" is
remembered with an admiration never felt before (faucet may be
substituted for well by those who live in a city).</p>

<p>Colombo is situated on the island of Ceylon just below the southernmost
point of the mainland of India. Here, too, is a commodious
harbor visited by all merchant fleets. It vies with Singapore as an
equatorial port. The "spicy breezes" of Ceylon are immortalized in
song and story&mdash;it is the land</p>

<p>At Kandy, about seventy-five miles from the coast, there is an
excellent botanical garden rivaling the garden at Buitenzorg, even as
Kandy itself rivals Buitenzorg as a summer resort. (There are extensive
gardens at Singapore and Penang, but they are inferior to those
in Ceylon and Java.) These gardens are about equally distant from
the equator; the former north, the latter south, but the garden at
Kandy has twice the altitude of the other. We were interested in
comparing the plants and examining the new specimens. While
Buitenzorg is superior in her collection of orchids the ferns at Kandy
surpass anything we have seen. Here the yellow bamboo is added to
the varieties seen elsewhere; here, too, we saw the screw palm, whose
leaves form a spiral line like the thread of a screw. Another curious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
variety is the sealing wax palm, the higher joints of which look
exactly like red sealing wax. The travelers' palm, which we also saw
in Java, is to be found here, its name being derived from the fact that
each leaf stem catches and holds sufficient water to slake a traveler's
thirst. The talipot palm attracts the attention of all visitors, not
only because its leaves formed the parchment for the early books of
Buddhism, but because it flowers but once, and then, as if exhausted
by its half century's effort, dies. The sensitive plant grows wild here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
and seems almost human in its perception, as it shrinks from the
slightest touch and folds its leaves as if withered.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 350px;"><a name="carpenter" id="carpenter"></a>
<img src="images/ill091.jpg" width="350" height="458" alt="carpenter" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">SINGALESE CARPENTER.</p></div>
</div>

<p>I have already spoken of the fruits of the tropics, especially those
of Java, but I think I ought to qualify my words. Since reveling in
mangosteens, rambutans, etc., I have eaten an apple and am convinced
that no tropical fruit can compare with it; and when to the
apple are added the peach, the pear, the plum and the cherry, and to
these fruits of the trees are added the grape, the strawberry, the raspberry
and the blackberry, not to speak of the pineapples, oranges and
bananas of our southern states, who will say that the temperate zone
is not as highly favored as the warmer lands?</p>

<p>We not only have an abundance of both the necessaries and the
luxuries, but we escape some of the torments of the tropics. Animals,
reptiles and insects run riot here. The tiger is "man-eating," the serpents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
are large and poisonous and the insects are omnipresent. We
sometimes complain at home of the mosquito, which seems to be a
universal pest, and found everywhere, "from Greenland's icy mountains
to India's coral strands," but here its activity is perennial and
its appetite reaches its maximum. In all the hotels the beds are protected
by mosquito bars, for without them sleep would be impossible.
The ant is even more annoying than the mosquito, for while the
former does most of its prowling at night, the latter "improves each
shining hour." If the natives play the sluggard, it is because they
refuse to profit by the example of industry which the ant ever presents
to them. It is not uncommon for the legs of dining tables and
cupboards to be set in bowls of water as a protection from these
insects, and where this precaution is not taken the diner divides his
time between eating and fighting ants. The white ant has a literary
turn of mind and pays especial attention to books. We have heard
of several libraries being ravaged by this insect, the leaves being so
perforated that the books looked like honeycombs. In his search for
knowledge the ant has the companionship of the cockroach, which
grows here to the length of two or three inches, can fly, and stains
what it can not devour. The house lizard is always in evidence. One
evening we counted twenty-four of these interesting little reptiles in
sight at one time on our porch. At night lizards in the trees
call hoarsely to each other, and when it rains the air is vocal with the
croaking of frogs and the singing of insects.</p>

<p>In the Botanical Garden at Kandy we saw hundreds of flying
foxes, which look like buzzards. Some of these flying foxes measure
four feet from tip to tip.</p>

<p>I find that there is a disease in these latitudes called tropical frenzy&mdash;an
uncontrollable anger which sometimes manifests itself when
European officials deal with native subjects. This has been seriously
discussed in medical meetings, and it has been argued that acts of violence
on the part of officials should be excused on this ground. The
subject has been scientifically considered at a meeting of German
physicians. This disease seems to be confined to Europeans, the
natives being immune from it&mdash;at least, it is not considered a good
defense when urged by a native as an excuse for doing violence to a
European.</p>

<p>My experience with the money changers of the Orient has made
the money changers of America seem virtuous by comparison. This
is the worst place for shaving, for discounts, for premiums, for commissions
and for exchange that I have visited. In traveling, one ha<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>s
frequently to change money from the currency of one nation to that
of another, and as there seems to be no fixed rate, he never knows
what he is going to realize. (By the way, one who thinks that a gold
dollar is good the world around can learn something from the discounts.)
At Colombo I had some Singapore bills converted into
rupees. The cashier at the hotel said that the rate was one-twenty,
and gave me twelve rupees for ten dollars. A few minutes afterwards
I had occasion to buy some tickets of a tourist agent and he allowed
me fifteen rupees for ten dollars; the next time I made change I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
received sixteen rupees and seventy cents for ten. This is a sample
of the experience one has here. At Singapore I drew some money on
my letter of credit which calls for pounds; as I was going into English
territory, I thought it would be convenient to carry some five pound
notes, but the bank insisted on converting the pounds into Singapore
dollars at eight-forty-five, and then offered to sell me five pound notes
at the rate of eight-seventy. When I related the incident to an Englishman,
he recalled an instance where a man presented a two hundred
pound note and asked for smaller bills; the bank charged him
a commission for converting the larger bills into rupees and then
another commission for converting the rupees into five pound notes.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 350px;"><a name="tamil" id="tamil"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">TAMIL GIRL&mdash;CEYLON.</p></div>
</div>

<p>I found in China that the notes issued by a bank in one city would
be discounted when presented at a branch of the same bank in another
city. Throughout the Malay states the Chinese are conspicuous as
money lenders, but at Singapore they come into competition with the
Indians, who are their superior in this line of business. At Colombo
we saw no Chinese at all.</p>

<p>We have found the American missionary everywhere, but his work
among the Malays is less promising than anywhere else. Missionary
work has been quite successful among the Chinese in the Malay archipelago
and among the Tamils at Singapore, but nearly all the Malays
are Mohammedans, and while they believe in one God and recognize
Christ as a great prophet, they believe the author of their religion to
have been a superior teacher.</p>

<p>In traveling, one has an opportunity to study human nature in all
its phases, and in an extended trip meets representatives of all the
nations. The North German Lloyd has a line running from Yokohama
to Bremen. (This line, I may add, makes it possible for one
to go from San Francisco to New York within two months, with but
two changes of boat, and still stop long enough at the principal ports
to learn something of the cities and the people.) We went from Singapore
to Colombo on one of the boats of this line. Besides a few
Americans, Germans and Hollanders, and a still larger number
of English, there were several Japanese en route for
Europe, and Russian officers and soldiers returning from
Japan. We made some agreeable acquaintances among the company,
as it is possible to do on every voyage, but just before leaving the boat
at Colombo we came into contact with a tourist who belonged to the
genus hog. Our boat arrived between eight and nine in the evening,
and the porters informed us that the hotels were full, but that we
could obtain rooms in the morning, as a number would leave on our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
ship. I stated the case to the captain, and he assured me that we were
welcome to remain on board until morning. Just as my wife and
daughter were retiring, a man came on board, followed by a lot of
baggage, and directed his porter to put it in our room. I explained to
him that not being able to find accommodations on shore, we had
obtained permission to occupy the room until morning, but he
brusquely replied that he had engaged the room two months before
and must have it. I called his attention to the fact that the boat was
late in reaching port and would not leave until nearly noon the next
day, and suggested as politely as I could that the captain was the
proper person to decide whether he was entitled to claim the room
under the circumstances. Without consulting the captain he went to
the steward and demanded that the ladies be moved to another room,
although another room was placed at his disposal for the night. It
required some plain, straightforward and emphatic language to bring
him to the point where he was willing to occupy a different room
temporarily, and I am afraid that he still regards Americans as very
rude and uncouth creatures. He is, however, the first man whom I
have met so far who would claim as a right that to which he was not
entitled, and then demand the enforcement of the assumed right without
regard to the convenience of others.</p>

<p>On the last mentioned trip we witnessed a burial at sea, the first
that has occurred during our voyage. One of the passengers died
after we left Singapore, and we learned of it while the funeral services
were in progress. The corpse was enclosed in a black (weighted)
coffin in which several holes were bored. The ship slackened its
speed, and as the band played a funeral dirge, the body was slowly
lowered. Upon reaching the water it floated back for a short distance
and then disappeared. It was a sad sight to see the remains of a
human being consigned to a watery tomb with nothing to mark its
resting place; and yet he does not sleep alone, for in this mighty
ocean sepulcher myriads lie buried and the waves moan above them
a requiem as sweet as that sung by the trees to those who rest upon
the land.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<h3>BURMA AND BUDDHISM.</h3>


<p>Burma is another country which was added to our list after leaving
home, but as its people are quite distinct from the inhabitants of
India and as it is one of the strongholds of Buddhism, we turned
aside to visit it en route from Ceylon to Calcutta. On the map it occupies
a part of the east side of the first of the three great peninsulas
that stretch down from Asia to the Indian ocean and is separated
from India proper by the Bay of Bengal. Its principal stream is the
Irawaddy, famed in story for the magnificent scenery along its
course and for the fertile valley through which it passes on its way
to the sea.</p>

<p>Rangoon, the seaport of Burma, is situated some twenty miles
inland upon a river of the same name, and has a harbor quite different
from those at Singapore and Colombo. At those places the passengers
on the incoming and outgoing steamers amuse themselves by
tossing silver coins into the transparent waters and watching the
divers catch them before they can reach the bottom, but at Rangoon
the water is so muddy that a diver would have difficulty in finding an
electric light. The depth of the water, too, is insufficient except when
the tide is high. But the city of Rangoon is substantially built and
has a number of fine business blocks and excellent public buildings.
A municipal hospital now in course of construction surpasses anything
which we have seen in the East. The park system at Rangoon
is very attractive, and one sees the well-to-do element of the city fully
represented there in the early evening. The roads about Rangoon
are good, but not equal to those of Ceylon and Java. I have already
spoken of the Java roads, and those of Ceylon are not behind them.
No one can see these well graded, well drained and beautifully shaded
highways without having his interest in good roads quickened.</p>

<p>At Rangoon we saw the elephants at work in a lumber yard, but
they do not attract anything like the attention from the natives that
"Jumbo" and the "Baby Elephant" did in the United States during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
my boyhood days. It is not necessary here for the head of the family
to take his wife and all the children to the circus in order that the
younger members of the family may catch a glimpse of one of these
ungainly beasts. In Burma the elephant is simply an everyday beast
of burden and earns his food as faithfully as the horse or the ox. We
saw three at work in the lumber yard which we visited, the oldest of
which is more than threescore and ten years, and has labored industriously
for more than fifty years. A native rides upon his back and
directs him by word, sometimes emphasized by an iron pointed stick,
and the huge fellow lifts, pushes and twists the logs about with almost
human intelligence. The elephant has an eye for neatness, and one
would hardly believe from hearsay with what regularity and carefulness
he works, moving from one end of the log to the other until it
is in exactly the right place. In lifting he uses his tusks, kneeling
when his work requires it. In carrying large blocks of wood he uses
both tusks and trunk. Sometimes the elephant pushes a heavy log
along the ground with one of his forefeet, walking on the other three,
but generally the logs are drawn by a chain attached to a broad breast
strap. An eighteen-year-old elephant, working in the same yard, was
thus drawing heavy timbers and went about his work uncomplainingly
so long as he was permitted to draw one at a time, but when
two of these timbers were fastened together, he raised his voice in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
pathetic lament which grew more touching when he received a
pointed suggestion from his driver. These trumpetings were really
terrifying to a stranger, but did not seem to alarm the Burmese. The
ears of the old elephant showed signs of age; in fact, they were thin
and frayed with flapping and looked like drooping begonia leaves.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="elephant" id="elephant"></a>
<img src="images/ill093.jpg" width="450" height="273" alt="elephant" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">AN ELEPHANT AT WORK IN RANGOON.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The elephants which we saw weighed about two tons each, and
consumed about 800 pounds of feed per day. When I was informed
that an elephant ate regularly one-fifth of his own weight per day,
I could understand better than ever before what it means to "have an
elephant on one's hands." The fact that they can be profitably used
in business shows their capacity for work. The old song that credits
the elephant with eating all night as well as all day is founded on
fact, for the animal requires but two hours' sleep out of twenty-four,
and when not otherwise employed, he puts in his time eating.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="rangoon" id="rangoon"></a>
<img src="images/ill094.jpg" width="450" height="283" alt="rangoon" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE PARK AT RANGOON.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The elephant, notwithstanding his huge bulk and massive strength,
is a very timid animal, and can be put to flight by a dog or even a
rat. A short time ago a drove of Rangoon elephants was stampeded
by an automobile, and it is well known the shipping of an elephant
is a difficult task. The elephant has a small hole resembling a knife
cut, on the side of the head, and at times a watery fluid is discharged
therefrom. For some reason, apparently unknown, the animal is subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
to frenzy during the period of this discharge and must be kept in
confinement.</p>

<p>Mandalay, the second city of Burma, is 386 miles north of Rangoon,
by rail, and is situated on the Irawaddy river. Kipling, in his poem,
declares that "the flying fishes play," "on the road to Mandalay," but
he has been guilty of using poetic license. The captain of one of the
steamers warned us in advance that no flying fish would be seen on the
river, and one Englishman went so far as to say that the poet had never
been in Mandalay. We planned to take a ride up the river, but our
purpose was thwarted by a sandbar which detained our boat from noon
until the next morning, so that our view of the river while very
thorough at that point, was not very extensive. Most tourists go to
Mandalay by train and return as far as Prome by boat, but the scenery
is finer in the defiles above Mandalay.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="pagoda" id="pagoda"></a>
<img src="images/ill095.jpg" width="450" height="287" alt="pagoda" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">FIVE HUNDRED PAGODA AT MANDALAY.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In going by land from Rangoon to Mandalay one sees nothing but
rice, but this is piled along the road in seemingly inexhaustible quantities.
One is reminded of the wheat and corn states of our own country
as he sees the piles of sacks and loose grain awaiting shipment. While
there are other industries in Burma, the rice fields and the piles of teak
wood are most in evidence. In northern Burma there are some rich
ruby mines and the jewelry stores are as fascinating as those of Ceylon.</p>

<p>The gongs of Mandalay are famous throughout the world for richness
of tone, and carving in ivory, teak and sandalwood gives employment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
to many artisans. Elephants and images of Buddha in wood, brass and
alabaster are exposed for sale in all the shops, and the silks are delicate
in texture and beautiful in color and design.</p>

<p>The Burmese have a large mixture of Chinese blood, as is shown by
their features and traits of character, but they are darker in color. They
are a cheerful and docile people, and their women have never been the
victims of seclusion that burdens the life of the women of India. Both
men and women wear gay colors, which lends picturesqueness to the
scenes of the street. In China and Japan we were amused at the small
pipes used by the men. In Burma one is amazed at the enormous cigarettes&mdash;six
inches long and an inch thick&mdash;which the women smoke.</p>

<p>In Burma, as in other Oriental countries, the streams are the wash-tubs
of the nation, and a flat stone takes the place of a washboard. It
was wash day on the Irawaddy when we started out on our boat ride,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
and the bank of the river looked like a flower bed, so bright and varied
were the colors of the turbans and dresses of the long row of washers
swinging the clothes high above their heads and beating them upon the
stones.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">BUDDHIST TEMPLE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Burma is the home of the pagoda; one is never out of sight of
them, but they differ in shape from those seen in China and Japan.
The Burmese pagoda is usually circular, though sometimes octagonal.
The largest of these is known as the Shwe Dagon Pagoda
at Rangoon. It is a solidly built pyramidal cone, with gradually
diminishing outline and is surmounted by a ti or "umbrella"
spire of concentric iron rings from which hang little bells
which tinkle when moved by the breeze. This pagoda has a circumference
of 1,355 feet at the base, rises to a height of 370 feet, and stands
upon a terraced mound which is itself 160 feet above the level of the
country around. The upper part of the pagoda is gilded, and its base is
surrounded by many elaborate shrines containing images of Buddha.
Here the faithful offer their devotions during the day and evening,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE SHWE DAGON PAGODA.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Mandalay is still more liberally supplied with pagodas. At the
largest, the Aracan, one sees repeated the scenes of the Shwe Dagon,
only the beggars seem more numerous. At this pagoda there is a filthy
pool in which live a number of sacred turtles, and they must have
charmed lives to live at all in so foul a place. They rise to the surface
when food is thrown into the water, but they are so slow in their movements
that the kites which hover about the place generally snatch up
the morsels before the turtles reach them.</p>

<p>Far more beautiful than the Aracan Pagoda is the group known as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
Four Hundred and Fifty. This remarkable group, which actually numbers
729, stands at the foot of Mandalay Hill and was built by an uncle of
King Thebaw. In the center of the group is the usual pagoda, and
around it in parallel, rectangular rows are small square pagodas,
each terminating in a graceful tower and containing a slab inscribed
on both sides. These slabs together contain all the writings of Buddha,
and the smaller pagodas viewed from the center one, present an
imposing spectacle. These pagodas are well kept, and all the buildings
are snowy white. I emphasize the fact that these are in good
repair, because so many of the Buddhist pagodas and monasteries
are in a state of decay. Whether this is due to decrease in the zeal
of the followers of Buddha or to the fact that the Burmese king,
Thebaw, has for more than twenty years been a political prisoner on
the west coast of India, I do not know. A writer for one of the Rangoon
newspapers naively describes the annexation of Burma by the English
as "necessary" and this "necessity" has deprived the Buddhist buildings
of the governmental patronage which they formerly enjoyed.</p>

<p>About six miles above Mandalay, near the Irawaddy, stands the
foundation of a pagoda which its builder intended should be the largest
in the world. It was begun by King Bodopaya in 1790, after an unsuccessful
campaign against Siam. In his disappointment his mind turned
to religion, and he hoped to "acquire merit," as the Buddhists say, by
the erection of this temple. The structure begins with four galleries;
the first is five hundred feet square; and each succeeding one is a little
higher by fifty feet less in diameter. Then the base of the pagoda
proper, about two hundred and fifty feet square, rises to a height of one
hundred and sixty feet. The entire building, as planned, would have
reached to a height of five hundred feet, but the labor expended had
become so great that the people complained and he was compelled to
abandon the enterprise. He was warned by the experience of a former
king whose extravagance gave rise to the proverb, "The pagoda is
finished and the country is ruined." King Bodopaya is not the only
"captain of industry" who has attempted to "acquire merit" by constructing
monumental buildings with the labor of others, but he was
not so successful as some of our trust magnates have been.</p>

<p>To match this great pagoda a bell was cast weighing ninety tons, said
to be the largest sound bell in the world. The great bell of Moscow is
larger, but is cracked. The Mingoon bell, as this one near Mandalay
is called, is eighteen feet in diameter at the base, nine feet at the top
and thirty-one feet in height to the top of the shackle. It was formerly
supported on immense teak wood beams, but the foundation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
one of these gave away and for years one side of the bell rested on
the ground. Lord Curzon, while viceroy of India, caused the bell to
be suspended from iron beams and put a roof over it.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">BURMESE FAMILY.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The Buddhist priests seem to have made Mandalay their Mecca, for
of the fifty-seven thousand in Burma, more than seven thousand reside
there. The Buddhist priesthood is the greatest mendicant order
in the world, the members of it being pledged to live by begging.
Having occasion to ride out early one morning we saw a hundred or
more bareheaded, barefooted, their only garb a yellow robe, carrying
their rice bowls from door to door. They can not ask for food by word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
of mouth; they simply hold out the bowl and if food is denied, they
move silently to another house. They are permitted to own no
property except a robe, a bowl, a leather mat, a razor, a needle, a
fan and a filter-cup. They must live under a tree unless someone
furnishes them a house and must live on roots and herbs unless better
food is given them. They have no parishes or congregations,
but are expected to spend their lives in meditation, free from all
worldly cares, except when engaged in expounding Buddhistic writing
or in teaching the young. They live, as a rule, in monasteries, built
for them by pious Buddhists, and from what we saw of these buildings
no one would accuse them of being surrounded by luxury. These monasteries
rest upon posts some distance above the ground, and each room
has an outside door about large enough for one to enter upon his hands
and knees.</p>

<p>I visited one of these monasteries at Rangoon in company with a
native Christian whose father was half Chinese. To my surprise the first
priest whom I met was an Englishman who turned Buddhist five years
ago and donned the yellow robe. While I waited for the native priest to
whom I had a letter, this Englishman gave me something of his history
and a brief defense of his new faith. He came from London six years
ago as a ship carpenter and a year after adopted Buddhism, which, he
explained to me, does not require one to believe anything. While his
parents were members of the Church of England, he had never connected
himself with any church, and, being an agnostic, the doctrines
of Buddha appealed to him. He described his adopted religion as one of
works rather than faith, and declared that the slums of Christendom
had no counterpart in Burma. The visitor, however, sees everywhere
poverty and squalor which can only be paralleled in the most destitute
portions of our great cities, and nowhere the comfort and refinement
which are general in the United States.</p>

<p>Buddhism is reformed Hinduism and in its teachings presents a
higher system of ethics than the religion from which it sprung. Gautama,
called the Buddha or the Enlightened, was born between five and
six hundred years before Christ, and was of the Brahmin caste. Not
satisfied with the teachings of the Hindu philosopher concerning life,
he went into seclusion at the age of twenty-nine and devoted himself to
meditation. Six years later he announced his doctrine, destined to impress
so profoundly the thought of the Orient. Accepting the Hindu
theory that the soul passes from person to person, and even from the
human being to the animal and back, he offered Nirvana as a final
release from this tiresome and endless change. Nirvana, a state of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
unconsciousness which follows the absorption of the individual soul in
the soul of the universe. This was the end to be sought, and no wonder
it came as a relief to those whose philosophy taught the perpetual transition
of the soul through man and beast and bird and reptile. The
means of reaching Nirvana was through the renunciation of self. Life
he conceived to be prolonged misery, infinitely drawn out, and love of
self he declared to be the root of all evil. So long as one loves life,
he argued, he can not escape from the bondage of existence. In the
entire elimination of self by the relinquishment of a desire for a separate
existence here or hereafter&mdash;in this alone could he find a path to
Nirvana.</p>

<p>The next forty-five years of his life he spent in expounding and
elaborating his doctrines, in formulating rules and in perfecting the
details of his system. Many of his precepts are admirable. For instance,
he divides progress toward the blissful state into three stages. In the
first, he puts those who abstain from evil from fear of punishment;
these he commends, though he considers the motive comparatively low.
In the second stage are those who, passing from negative harmlessness
to helpfulness, do good from hope of reward; these he praises as acting
from a higher motive than the first. In the third state the seeker after
Nirvana does good, not for hope of reward, but for the sake of love
alone. The last gift love has to give, is to give up love of life itself and
pass from further change to changeless changelessness.</p>

<p>At one time Buddhism spread over India and promised the conquest
of all Asia. Two hundred years after the Buddhist's death a
great king, Asoka, sent out eighty-four thousand missionaries and
the doctrines of Gautama were accepted as far east as China and
Japan, and as far south as Java. But the wave receded; India
returned to Hinduism, China to Confucianism and Japan to Shintoism,
and Mohammedanism now outnumbers Buddhism on the
Ganges. The Buddhists still hold Burma, Thibet and Ceylon, but
even in these countries there is evidence of decline. Kandy, the
capital city of Ceylon, has the distinction of guarding a "sacred
tooth," thought by the ignorant to be one of the eyeteeth of Buddha.
It is kept in a gold and jeweled casket enclosed in six larger ones
and is an object of worship, but the more intelligent Buddhists know
that it is a fraud.</p>

<p>At Rangoon I found a Baptist school, conducted by Americans,
with nearly nine hundred pupils, and learned of the gratifying success
which has attended missionary work in Burma.</p>

<p>And yet, there is a Buddhist propaganda in Europe and America!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a><br /><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
In a review called Buddhism, published at Rangoon by the International
Buddhist Society, I read that Kaiser Wilhelm is "alarmed"
at the progress that this religion is making in Germany, and I also
read that our country offers a promising field for Buddhist missionaries.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">BRONZE IMAGE OF BUDDHA, BUILT 1252</p></div>
</div>

<p>As a religion of agnosticism, requiring belief in neither God nor
immortality, nor in the morality taught by Christ, it may appeal to
some who, like the Englishman whom I found in the monastery, have
already rejected Christianity, but it is not likely to appeal to those
who have had religious experience. Those who emphasize good works,
and fail to recognize the need of an inspiring faith behind the works,
may take refuge in the teachings of Buddha from the more exacting
requirements of the Nazarene, but no one is likely to be led astray
who compares the altruism, the philanthropy and the benevolences of
Christianity with the fruits of Buddhism. To live, even in poverty,
upon the labors of others with a view to gaining thus an earlier
entrance into blissful unconsciousness is not so unselfish after all, as
to spend one's self in the service of his fellows and to convert life into
an exhaustless fountain.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<h3>EASTERN INDIA.</h3>


<p>We have at least reached India&mdash;and what extremes are here!
Southern India penetrates the Indian Ocean and is so near the
Equator that the inhabitants swelter under the heat of a perpetual
summer, while the rocky sentinels that guard the northern frontier
are clad in the ice of an eternal winter. As might be expected in a
land which has every altitude from sea level to nearly thirty thousand
feet, one finds all varieties of vegetation, from the delicate fern of the
tropics to the sturdy edelweiss that blossoms in the snow&mdash;from the
grain and orchards of Agra, Oudh and the Punjab to the cotton, rice
and fruits of Bombay, Calcutta and Madras. The extremes are as
noticeable among the people as in nature's realm. In learning there
is a great gulf between the Hindu pundit and the ignorant ryot; there
is a wide sea between the wealth of the native prince and the poverty
of the masses; and there is a boundless ocean between the government
and the people.</p>

<p>Eastern India is entered through Calcutta, a city of more than a
million inhabitants which has been built up under British occupancy.
It is the capital of the province of Bengal and the winter capital of
British India. I say winter capital because the higher English officials
have their headquarters at Simla, eight thousand feet up in the
Himalayas, during eight months of the year. Calcutta is on the
Hooghly river, one of the numerous mouths of the Ganges; and the
Ganges, it may be added, is a little disappointing to one who has read
about it from youth. Instead of being a large river, flowing down
from the Himalayas directly to the sea, it is neither of great length
nor of great width. It runs for hundreds of miles along the foot of
the range and joins the Brahmaputra, which comes from an opposite
direction and apparently is much longer. The mouths of the
joint stream form a delta like that of the Nile, which at the coast is
something like two hundred miles wide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>Lacking the antiquity of the cities of the interior, Calcutta does not
possess many things of interest to the tourist, no elaborate tombs, no
massive mosques and few temples of importance, although all shades
of religion are represented here. There is a very pretty Jain temple in
the suburbs, and in the city there is a Hindu temple where goats are
offered as a sacrifice, but the center of Hinduism is at Benares, while
Agra, Delhi and Lucknow furnish the finest specimens of the taste
of the Mohammedan rulers. There are at Calcutta some fine public
buildings and less pretentious private blocks, some beautiful parks
and a very extensive museum.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="ghat" id="ghat"></a>
<img src="images/ill102.jpg" width="450" height="290" alt="" title="ghat" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">CALCUTTA BURNING GHAT.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In this museum one can learn more of the various races of India,
of their dress, implements and weapons, more of the animal and
insect life, more of India's mineral wealth, more of her woods, stones
and marbles, more of her agricultural products and manufactures
than he can in weeks of travel. He sees here mounted specimens of
bug and butterfly, bird, fish and beast. It is the very Mecca of the
student and we saw a number of groups thus engaged. Among the
insects there are several which illustrate the mimicry of nature to a
marvelous degree. Some are like dried grass, some like moss and some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
like leaves. The most remarkable of these is the leaf insect which can
scarcely be detected from a leaf even after it has been pointed out.
There is a mountain grouse which turns white in the winter, and in
some countries a hare which undergoes the same change. In Ceylon
there are crabs with legs like pieces of coral and a color closely
resembling the sand upon which they crawl, but the leaf insect surpasses
them all. Not only is its color identical with the leaf, but its
body and wings are veined and ribbed like a leaf; even rust spots
could be found on some of them. We could hardly have believed our own
eyes had we not seen some of these insects alive and some of the
young just hatched.</p>

<p>The botanical garden, while not equal in variety or beauty to the
gardens at Buitenzorg and Kandy, has one object of growing interest,
viz., a gigantic banyan tree. This tree is nearly a century and a
half old and shades a spot of ground almost a thousand feet in circumference.
Great arms run out from the parent trunk and these are supported
by four hundred and sixty-four ærial roots or minor trunks,
some of which are several feet in diameter. Seen from a distance the
tree presents a very symmetrical appearance, and, as it is still growing,
it is likely to become, if it is not already, the largest tree in the world.</p>

<p>The zoological garden contains some excellent specimens. We were
especially interested in the Bengal tigers, in a red-nosed African
mandrill (which looks like a cross between a hog and an ape), and
in the monkeys. Three of the latter belong to the shouting variety&mdash;at
least, they do shout. When the attendant gives the cue, they set up
such a chorus of ear-splitting yells as one seldom hears. The echoing
and re-echoing makes a din before which the noise of a football game
seems tame. While not a football enthusiast, I venture the suggestion
that an American team would do well to secure the assistance of these
rooters, for they could work up the necessary enthusiasm on short
notice and with a great saving to the throats of the students.</p>

<p>On the streets of Calcutta one sees Indian life in all its forms.
The coolies wear the lightest possible clothing and carry enormous
burdens on their heads. I saw eight of them hurrying down the
street at a fast walk bearing a grand piano on their heads. In another
place one man carried a large Saratoga trunk on his head down the
hotel stairs. He had to have assistance in lifting and lowering it,
but when it was once balanced on his head he marched off with it
with apparent ease. The coolie women also carry burdens upon their
heads, water jars being their specialty. Two and even three of these,
one on top of another, are sometimes carried in this way. The brass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
water pot is, by the way, never out of sight in India; it is to be seen
everywhere, and the scouring of these pots seems to give employment
for leisure moments.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="prince" id="prince"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE MAHARAJA OF MOURBHARAG&mdash;AN INDIAN PRINCE</p></div>
</div>

<p>While much carrying is done on the head and on the pole, carts of
all kinds are numerous. The water buffalo is to be found in India,
but he divides the honors with the Indian bullock as a beast of
burden. The Indian bullock is a mild-eyed beast, usually white or
light in color, and has a hump on the shoulders which seems to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
made expressly for the yoke. There is a small variety of the bullock,
which is used for drawing passenger carts, and some of these are so
fast that they are entered in trotting races.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 350px;"><a name="princess" id="princess"></a>
<img src="images/ill104.jpg" width="350" height="572" alt="princess" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">INDIAN PRINCESS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The merchants of India are a shrewd and persistent class. They
press their wares upon one at the hotels and in their shops, and the
purchaser never knows whether he is buying at a bargain or paying
two or three prices. It is not at all uncommon for the dealer to begin
negotiations with the assertion that he has but one price and that his
conscience will not allow him to ask more than a fair price, and conclude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
by selling at a twenty-five or fifty per cent discount. It may be
that natives are treated differently, but the foreigner is likely to be
charged "what the traffic will bear."</p>

<p>You can not judge of the value of a merchant's stock by the size
or appearance of his store. He may have a little booth open in front,
with no show windows, but when he begins to bring out his trunks
and bundles, he may exhibit jewelry worth a hundred thousand dollars,
or rich embroideries worth their weight in gold. The merchant
sits cross-legged on the floor and spreads out the wares which his
attendants bring, beguiling you the while with stories of Lord So and
So's purchase, or Lady What's Her Name's order, or of a check for
thousands handed him by an American millionaire.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="banyan" id="banyan"></a>
<img src="images/ill105.jpg" width="450" height="195" alt="banyan" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE GREAT BANYAN TREE&mdash;CALCUTTA.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The native buildings are, as a rule, neither beautiful nor cleanly.
The little shops that open on the street exhibit food and vegetables
arranged in heaps, the vendor apparently indifferent to dust and flies.
The houses are generally of adobe, plastered with mud and without
floors. In the warmer sections of the country they are built of matting
and bamboo. The rich Indians live in substantial homes with
high ceilings, tile floors and spacious verandas, but these are very few
compared with the mass of the poor.</p>

<p>The Indian women of the higher classes are in seclusion all the
time. They seldom leave their homes and when they do venture out
they travel in covered chairs or closed carriages. This custom was
brought into India by the Mohammedan conquerors, but it has been
generally adopted by Hindu society. There is a growing sentiment
among the educated Hindus against this practice, so burdensome to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a><br /><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
woman, but custom yields slowly to new ideas. At Calcutta we
met several Indian ladies of high social rank who, in their home life,
have felt the influence of western ideas and who have to some extent
lessened the rigors of the zenana (seclusion). Two of these ladies,&mdash;one
a princess&mdash;were daughters of the famous Keshub Chunder Sen,
the great Hindu reformer, whose writing made a profound impression
on the religious thought of the world. In the group was also a
daughter-in-law of Mr. Sen's, a brilliant woman who was left the
widow of a native prince at the age of thirteen and who recently
shocked the orthodox Hindus by a second marriage. I mention these
ladies because they represent the highest type of Indian womanhood,
and it would be difficult to find in any country, in a group of the
same size, more beauty, culture and refinement.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><a name="calcutta" id="calcutta"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">A CALCUTTA STREET&mdash;INDIA</p></div>
</div>

<p>The principal article of feminine dress is the sarai, a long strip of
cotton or silk, part of which is wrapped about the body to form a
skirt, while the rest is draped over the head and shoulders in graceful
folds. This garment lends itself to ornamentation and is usually embroidered
along the edges, sometimes with silver and gold. We have
not found in our travels a more becoming and attractive costume.</p>

<p>The dress of the men is so varied that description is impossible.
One form of dress resembles the Roman toga. Many wear trousers
made by mysterious windings and foldings of a long strip of cloth,
others wear loose pantaloons. The coats are as multiform, a long,
close-fitting one being the most popular. But the hat is the article to
which most care is given. While the fez is popular, it is not so conspicuous
as the turban. The latter is to be seen in all colors, shapes
and styles. Some of the educated Indians have adopted the European
dress, but the change in costume has not been rapid.</p>

<p>Calcutta is one of the educational centers of India, and one finds
in the city many of the leaders of thought, educational and political.
The University of Calcutta grants degrees and affiliates to itself the
colleges whose students are preparing for the university examinations.
Besides the university there are medical, law and technical schools
which draw young men from the entire country. The position taken
by Lord Curzon in the matter of higher education aroused so much
opposition among the native population that an association was
formed two years ago for the purpose of raising money to defray the
expenses of students desiring to study abroad. Last year fourteen
students were selected and sent to different countries. This year forty-four
are going, and I had the pleasure of meeting these at a public
reception given them at the town hall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>This meeting interested me very much. It was opened with a prayer
by Editor Sen, of the Indian Mirror, a liberal Hindu, and it was such
a prayer as might have been
offered in any American
church. It was so brief that I
quote it in full:</p>

<p>"We thank Thee, O God,
that by Thy blessing those
young men whom we sent
abroad for study last year are
doing their work well and
have by Thy grace been kept
in the right path. We are now
met to bid farewell to a much
larger number of our youths,
who are shortly leaving these
shores for study in distant
foreign lands. We ask Thy
abundant blessing on them,
and we humbly beseech Thee
to protect them in their travels
by sea and land and to
bring them all safely to their
respective destinations. May
they be diligent in their
studies, obedient to their
teachers, grateful to those by
whose help they are being
sent abroad, and blameless in
their conduct. May the love
and fear of God rule their
hearts, and may they return
to us and to those nearest and dearest to them in due course crowned
with full success and filled with an earnest desire to labor for the good
of their country and their poorer brethren. We commend them to Thy
gracious keeping as we now bid them a hearty farewell, and beseech
Thee to help us all to live and work for the glory of Thy name and the
good of our fellow men now and always."</p>

<p>Most of the students were going to Japan&mdash;one of the many indications
of that country's increasing influence in the Orient&mdash;some were
going to England and a few to America. Those bound for America<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
called upon me later at the hotel, and I found them an earnest and
ambitious group. They had, as all the Indians whom we met seemed
to have, a high opinion of our country and spoke with enthusiasm of
the benefits which they hoped to derive from their stay in the United
States. These, and other students with whom I came in contact, impressed
me as exceedingly patriotic and anxious to turn their information
and their ability to the advantage of their country.</p>

<p>In Calcutta there are a number of Indians, who have won prominence
in various spheres of activity. Editor Sen, to whom I have already
referred, is one of the most influential of the native editors and
writers; Editor Banerjee, of the Bengalee, is both a writer and an
orator, and the editor of the Patrika has made his paper an exponent
of advanced political thought. The Tagore family has furnished
several men prominent in religious, literary and official life; education
has found a patron in the Roy family, and Dr. Bose has won more
than a national reputation in science.</p>

<p>Those who visit Calcutta can not afford to miss the side trip to
Darjeeling, a summer resort perched upon the foothills of the Himalayas.
The journey is rather fatiguing&mdash;three hours to the Ganges,
then an all night ride to the foot of the range and then an eight hour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
climb on a two-foot gauge up the mountain side, but it amply repays
the effort. We count this experience among the richest that we have
enjoyed. The city of Darjeeling is about seven thousand feet above
the sea, and the sides of the Himalayas are so steep at this point that it
is only fifty miles down the zig-zag little railroad to the plain where
the elevation is but two or three hundred feet. I do not know where
one can find more of the grand and picturesque in the same distance
than on this narrow gauge that threads its way up the rocky sides of
this most stupendous of mountain ranges.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">VIEW OF THE HIMALAYAS, AS SEEN FROM DARJEELING.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Darjeeling is so near Thibet, Nepal, Sikkim and Bhutan that one
finds here a motley variety of types and sees something of the native
life of the forbidden land that stretches along the northern border of
India. The mountain tribes are sturdier in build, coarser in feature
and lighter in color than the people of the lowlands, and we saw some
types that strongly resembled the American Indian.</p>

<p>But to return to the mountains themselves; the view from Darjeeling
is unsurpassed. The Kinchinjunga Peaks rise to a height of 28,156<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
feet above the sea, or nearly twice as high as Pike's Peak, and though
forty-five miles distant, are clear and distinct. The summits, seen
above the clouds, seem to have no terrestrial base, but hang as if suspended
in mid air. The best view is obtained from Tiger Hill, six
miles from Darjeeling and two thousand feet higher. We made this
trip one morning, rising at three o'clock, and reaching the observation
point a little before sunrise. I wish I were able to convey to the
reader the impression made upon us.</p>

<p>While all about us was yet in darkness, the snowy robe which
clothes the upper twelve thousand feet of the range, caught a tint of
pearl from the first rays of the sun, and, as we watched, the orb of
day, rising like a ruby globe from a lake of dark blue mist, gilded
peak after peak until at last we saw Mt. Everest, earth's loftiest point,
one hundred and twenty miles away and nearly a thousand feet higher
than Kinchinjunga. We saw the shadows fleeing from the light like
hunted culprits and hiding in the deep ravines, and we marked the
triumph of the dawn as it swept down the valleys.</p>

<p>How puny seem the works of man when brought into comparison
with majestic nature! His groves, what pigmies when measured
against the virgin forest! His noblest temples, how insignificant when
contrasted with the masonry of the hills! What canvas can imitate
the dawn and sunset! What inlaid work can match the mosaics of
the mountains!</p>

<p>Is it blind chance that gives these glimpses of the sublime? And
was it blind chance that clustered vast reservoirs about inaccessible
summits and stored water to refresh the thirsty plains through hidden
veins and surface streams?</p>

<p>No wonder man from the beginning of history has turned to the
heights for inspiration, for here is the spirit awed by the infinite and
here one sees both the mystery of creation and the manifestations of
the Father's loving kindness. Here man finds a witness, unimpeachable
though silent, to the omnipotence, the omniscience and the goodness
of God.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<h3>HINDU INDIA.</h3>


<p>Before beginning the trip through the interior, a paragraph must
be given to Indian travel. There are no Pullman sleepers in this
country, and the tourist must carry his bedding with him. Night
trains have compartments containing broad seats which can be used
as couches and hanging shelves upon which one may lie. The traveler
carries his own blanket, pillow, sheet, towels, soap, etc., and occasionally
has to rely on these at hotels as well as on the trains. The cars are
entered from the side, and one must take his chance of waking at the
right station, for there is no official to give him warning. In India it
is customary for foreigners to take an Indian servant with them who
acts as an interpreter and looks after the baggage&mdash;and looking after
the baggage is no easy task in this part of the British empire. After
we had made one short trip without assistance we were glad to yield
to the custom, and Goolab, a Calcutta Mussulman, proved himself an
invaluable aid in dealing with the baggage coolies, whose language we
could not understand and whose charges vary from the legal rate as
the minimum to three or four times that if the tourist shows himself
a novice at the business.</p>

<p>The hotels of India are declared by the guide books to be bad, and
one does not feel like disputing these authorities after having made
the trip. I do not mean to say that there is no difference between
them, for in several places we found comfortable rooms and in some
places palatable food. Everywhere we were so interested in what we
saw that we could endure almost any kind of accommodations, but at
one place the fare was so unsatisfactory that we were reduced to eggs
and toast. Goolab, overhearing some mutterings of discontent, took
it upon himself to report in the hope of securing some improvement,
and the clerk asked me for particulars. I told him that I had not
intended to make any complaint, but that as he was good enough
to inquire, I would say that we did not like the cooking; that the
crackers were sometimes mouse-eaten and that we found worms in the
cabbage. He thought that the mice were inexcusable, but, as if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
question disposed of the matter, asked: "The worm was dead, wasn't
it?" I was compelled to admit that it was.</p>

<p>Leaving Calcutta, we sought the ancient city of Benares, which bears
the distinction of being the center of Hinduism. In fact, it has been
the religious capital of India for two thousand years or more.</p>

<p>At Sarnath, just outside Benares, stands the first Buddhist pagoda,
said to have been erected nearly five hundred years before the beginning
of the Christian era to commemorate a spot in the deer park
where Buddha taught his disciples. Recent excavations near there
have brought to light one of the Asoka pillars which, though unfortunately
broken, still bears testimony to the skill of the sculptor as
well as to the zeal of the great Buddhist king. But these ruins are
all that is left of Buddhism in this vicinity, where Buddha lived
and taught and where his doctrines were once triumphant, or Hinduism
has virtually rooted out Buddhism, adopting, it is said, the device
of making him one of the incarnations of their own god.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE CAMEL IN INDIA.</p></div>
</div>

<p>At Benares one sees idolatry in its grossest and most repulsive forms,
and it is therefore as interesting to-day to the student of the world's
great religions as to the devoted Hindu who travels hundreds of miles
over dusty roads to bathe in the Ganges, whose waters he considers
sacred. Benares is built upon the north bank of the Ganges, and it is
estimated that each year it is visited by a million pilgrims. When more
than three hundred miles from the city, we saw the caravan of one
of the Maharaja (Maharaja is the title borne by native princes) on its
way to the river. There were five elephants, a dozen camels and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
twenty or thirty bull carts, besides numerous pack animals and horses.
The trip could not be made in much less than two months, and all
this for the sake of a bath in the waters of the sacred river.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="spikes" id="spikes"></a>
<img src="images/ill112.jpg" width="400" height="272" alt="spikes" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">CULTIVATING PSYCHIC POWER ON SPIKES AT BENARES, INDIA.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The bank of the Ganges is lined for a long distance with bathing
ghats (as the steps leading to the river are called), and at one point
there is a burning ghat, where the bodies of the dead are cremated.
Cremation is universal among the Hindus, sandalwood being used
where the relatives can afford it. Taking a boat, as is customary, we
rowed up and down the river in the early morning, and such a sight!
Down the steps as far as the eye could reach came the bathers, men,
women and children, and up the steps went a constant stream of those
who had finished their ablutions. Most of them carried upon their
heads water pots of shining brass, and some carried bundles of wearing
apparel. The bathing is done leisurely as if according to ritual,
with frequent dippings; water is poured out to the sun and prayers
are said. The lame, the halt and the blind are there, some picking their
way with painful step, others assisted by friends. Here, a leper
sought healing in the stream; near him a man with a emaciated form
mixed his medicine with the holy water, and not far off a fakir with
matted hair prayed beneath his big umbrella. On one of the piers a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
young man was cultivating psychic power by standing on one leg
while he told his beads with his face toward the sun.</p>

<p>Dressing and undressing is a simple matter with the mass of the
people. Men and women emerging from the water throw a clean robe
around themselves, and then unloosing the wet garment, wring it
out and are ready to depart. Those who bring water pots fill them
from the stream, out of which they have recently come, and carry
them away as if some divinity protected the water from pollution. As
the river contains countless dead and receives the filth of the city as
well as the flowers cast into it by worshipers, it requires a strong faith
to believe it free from lurking disease and seeds of pestilence.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">BATHING GHAT ON THE GANGES.</p></div>
</div>

<p>When we reached the burning ghat, we found one body on the
funeral pyre and another soaking in the water as a preparation for
burning. So highly is the Ganges revered that aged people are
brought there that they may die, if possible, in the water. While we
were watching, a third body was prepared for the burning, and it was
so limp that death could not have occurred long before. While the
flames were consuming those three corpses, we saw coming down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
steps a man carrying the body of a child, apparently about two years
old, wrapped in a piece of thin cotton cloth. (The children of the
poor are buried in the stream because of the cost of wood.) The man
bore his lifeless burden to a little barge and made the corpse fast to a
heavy stone slab. The boatman then pushed out from the shore, and
when the middle of the stream was reached the man in charge of the
body dropped it overboard, and the burial was over.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="pundit" id="pundit"></a>
<img src="images/ill114.jpg" width="400" height="525" alt="pundit" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">PUNDIT SAKHARAM GANESH.</p></div>
</div>

<p>No one has seen India until he has seen the Ganges; no one has
seen the Ganges until he has seen it at Benares; and no one who has
seen the Ganges at Benares will ever forget it.</p>

<p>In the suburbs of the city stands the Durga Temple, better known as
the Monkey Temple, because it is the home of a large family of monkeys,
which are regarded as sacred. Photographs of the temple present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
rather an attractive appearance, but the original is anything but
beautiful, and the monkeys and general filth of the place deprive it of
all appearance of a place of worship.</p>

<p>The Golden Temple, however, is the one most visited by tourists,
and it would be difficult to picture a less inviting place. The buildings
are old and greasy, and the narrow streets are filled with images
and thronged with beggars. One finds his interest in missionary work
quickened if he wanders through these streets and sees the offering
of incense to the elephant god and the monkey god, and to images
innumerable. The air is heavy with perfume and the odor of decaying
flowers, and one jostles against the sacred bulls as he threads his
way through the crowd. We have not seen in any other land such
evidences of superstition, such effort to ward off evil spirits and to
conciliate idols. The educated Hindus, and there are many learned
men among the Hindus, regard these idols as only visible representations
of an invisible God, but the masses seem to look no farther than
the ugly images before which they bow.</p>

<p>It was a relief to find near this dark pool of idolatry an institution
of learning, recently founded, which promises to be a purifying spring.
I refer to the Central Hindu College, of which Mrs. Annie Besant, the
well known theosophist, is the head. Although the school is but seven
years old, it already includes a valuable group of buildings and has
some five hundred students. Among the professors are several Englishmen
who serve without compensation, finding sufficient reward in
the consciousness of service.</p>

<p>Next to Benares Allahabad is the most important Hindu center.
The city is on the Ganges, at its junction with the Jumna, one of its
longest branches. There is an old tradition that another river, flowing
underground, empties into the Ganges at this point, and the place is
referred to as the junction of the three rivers. The great Mogul Akbar
built a splendid fort where the Ganges and the Jumna meet, and
probably on this account Allahabad is the capital of the United Provinces
of Agra and Oudh. Within the walls of the fort there is another
of the Asoka pillars, a very well preserved one, forty-nine feet high
and bearing numerous inscriptions, among which are the famous
edicts of Asoka, issued in 240 <small>B. C.</small>, against the taking of life. Within
the fort in a subterranean room is another object of interest, the
Akhshai Bar or undecaying banyan tree. As this tree is described by
a Chinese pilgrim of the seventh century, it is either of remarkable
antiquity or has been renewed from time to time.</p>

<p>The religious importance of Allahabad is largely due to a fair which
is held there every year and which on every twelfth year becomes a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
national event. It is called the Mela, and last January brought to the
city a crowd estimated at from one and a half to three millions. This
every-twelfth-year fair brings together not only the devout Hindus,
who come as a matter of religious duty, and innumerable traders, who
at such times find a market for their wares, but it draws large numbers
of fakirs (pronounced fah-keers, with the accent upon the last
syllable) or holy men. They wear full beards and long hair and no
clothing except the breech cloth. They put ashes and even manure
upon their heads, and their hair and whiskers are matted and discolored.
These men are supposed to have raised themselves to a high
spiritual state by asceticism and self-punishment. They undergo all
sorts of hardships, such as hanging over a fire, holding up the arm
until it withers, and sitting upon a bed of spikes. We saw many
fakirs at Benares and Allahabad and some elsewhere (for they are
scattered over the whole country), and at the latter place one accommodated
us by taking his seat upon the spikes.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="types" id="types"></a>
<img src="images/ill115.jpg" width="450" height="344" alt="types" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">HINDU TYPES.</p></div>
</div>

<p>At the recent Mela five hundred of these fakirs marched in a procession
naked, even the breech cloth having been abandoned for the
occasion, and so great was the reverence for them that their followers
struggled to obtain the sand made sacred by their tread, a number of
people meeting their death in the crowd. These fakirs are supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a><br /><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
to have reached a state of sinlessness, but one of them seized a child
along the line of march and dashed out its brains in the presence of
its mother, claiming to be advised that the gods desired a human
sacrifice. He was arrested by the British officials and is now awaiting
trial on the charge of murder. The papers recently reported another
instance in which a fakir was the cause of a murder. He was consulted
by a woman who had lost several children and was anxious to
protect her prospective child from a like fate. The fakir told her that
she could insure her child's life if she would herself bathe in human
blood, and she and her husband enticed a seven-year-old boy into their
home and killed him to secure
the blood necessary for
the bath. The fakirs are not
only a danger to the community
in some cases and a
source of demoralization at
all times, but they are a
heavy drain upon the producing
wealth of the country.
Adding nothing to the
material, intellectual or moral
development of the country,
they live upon the fears
and credulity of the people.</p>

<p>The Hindu religion claims
something more than two
hundred millions of human
beings within its membership;
it teaches the transmigration
of the soul or reincarnation
as it is generally
called. The Hindu mind
takes kindly to the metaphysical, and the Hindu priests have evolved
an intricate system of philosophy in support of their religious beliefs.
Reincarnation is set forth as a theory necessary to bring God's plans
into accord with man's conception of justice. If a man is born blind
or born into unfavorable surroundings, it is explained on the theory
that he is being punished for sins committed during a former existence;
if he is born into a favorable environment he is being rewarded
for virtue previously developed.</p>

</div>

<p>It is not quite certain whether the Hindus have many gods or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
many forms of one god, for the ancient Vedas speak of each of several
gods as if they were supreme. The most popular god is a sort of trinity,
Bramah, the creator; Vischnu, the preserver, and Siva, the
destroyer, being united in one. Sometimes the trinity is spoken of as
representing creation, destruction and renovation, in which Krishna
appears as the principal god. Out of this system have sprung a multitude
of gods until the masses bow down "to sticks and stones."</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">MRS. BESANT'S COLLEGE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The most pernicious product of the Hindu religion is the caste system.
Infant marriage is terrible, but that will succumb to education;
the seclusion of the women is benumbing, but it will give way before
the spread of European and American influence, and with it will go
the practical servitude of widows, as the practice of suttee (the burning
of widows) has practically gone. But the caste system, resting upon
vanity, pride and egotism, is more difficult to eradicate. Nowhere in
the world is caste so inexorable in its demands or so degrading in its
influence. The line between the human being and the beast of the
field is scarcely more distinctly drawn than the line between the various
castes. The Brahmins belong to the priestly class, and are supposed
to have sprung from the mouth of Brahm, the great creator;
the Kshatrias, or warrior class, are supposed to have sprung from the
shoulders of Brahm; the Vaisyas, or merchant class, are supposed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
have sprung from the thighs of Brahm; while the Sudras, or laborers,
are supposed to have sprung from the feet of Brahm. There are
numerous sub-divisions of these castes, and besides these there are outcasts;
although there does not seem to be any room below the Sudras
for any other class. The caste system not only affects social intercourse
and political progress, but it complicates living. A high caste
Hindu can not accept food or drink from a low caste, and must purify
his water bottle if a low caste touches it.</p>

<p>About seventy years ago a reform in Hinduism was begun under
the name of Brahmo Somaj. It was built upon monotheism, or the
worship of one god, for which it claimed to find authority in the
Hindu sacred books. It drew to itself a number of strong men, among
them Mr. Tagore and Mr. Sen, the latter making a trip to England to
present the principles of the new faith before prominent religious
bodies there.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">A GALA DAY IN INDIA.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The Arya Somaj, another reform sect, sprung up later. Both of
these have exerted considerable influence upon the thought of India,
far beyond their numerical strength. So far, however, Christianity
has made greater inroads upon Hinduism than any of the reformations
that have been attempted from within.</p>

<p>At Allahabad we found two Christian colleges, the Allahabad Christian
College for men and the Wanamaker School for girls. Dr. A. H.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a><br /><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
Ewing is at the head of the former and Miss Foreman, the daughter
of an early missionary, at the head of the latter. Both of these schools
have been built with American money, Mr. Wanamaker having been
the most liberal patron. They are excellently located, are doing a
splendid work and are affiliated with the Presbyterian Church. Fifty
dollars will pay for the food, room, clothes and tuition of one boy,
while thirty dollars will provide for one girl, and interested Americans
have already established several scholarships, but money is badly
needed to enlarge the facilities of both these schools.</p>

<p>We spent the Sabbath at Allahabad and visited both of these schools,
and our appreciation of their work was enhanced by our observation
at Benares. It seemed like an oasis in the desert. Surely those who
have helped to create this green spot&mdash;may it ever widen&mdash;will find
intense satisfaction in the good that these schools are doing and will do.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

<h3>MOHAMMEDAN INDIA.</h3>


<p>Strictly speaking, the term, Mohammedan India, could only be
applied to those frontier districts in which the Mohammedans have a
preponderating influence, but the Mohammedan emperors left such
conspicuous monuments of their reign in Lucknow, Delhi and Agra
that it does not violate the proprieties to thus describe this section.
The Mohammedans themselves have laid virtual claim to this territory
by the establishment of their chief college at Aligahr, nearly equidistant
from Agra and Delhi, and their claim is still further strengthened
by the fact that while they have not a majority, they have a very
large percentage of the population of both of the last named cities.</p>

<p>In approaching this section of India from the east, the tourist passes
through Cawnpore, made memorable by the massacre of the British
residents during the mutiny of 1857. The recollection of the mutiny
is still fresh in the minds of the British officials, and numerous monuments
have been reared to the bravery of the besieged garrisons.</p>

<p>At Calcutta one is shown a black piece of pavement which covers a
part of the Black Hole of Calcutta (the rest of the hole is now covered
by a building) where in 1756 one hundred and forty-six human
beings were forced to spend the night and from which only twenty-three
escaped alive. The hole was twenty-two by fourteen feet and
only sixteen or eighteen feet in height, and the awful sufferings of
those who perished there are commemorated by an obelisk which
stands near by.</p>

<p>But the cruelty practiced at the time of the mutiny far more stirred
the English heart, and as the uprising was more extensive, several
cities contain memorials. Of these the most beautiful is at Cawnpore,
and is called "The Angel of the Resurrection." It is made of white
marble and represents an angel with hands crossed and each holding a
palm. It stands upon an elevated mound in a beautiful park, and is
enclosed by a stone screen. It was the gift of Lord and Lady Canning
and bears the following inscription: "Sacred to the perpetual memory
of a great company of Christian people, chiefly women and children,
who near this spot were cruelly murdered by the followers of the rebel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
Nana Dhundu Pant, of Bithur, and cast, the dying with the dead, into
the well below, on the 15th day of July, 1857."</p>

<p>There is also at Cawnpore, in another park, a stately memorial
church, the inner walls of which are lined with tablets containing the
names of British soldiers who lost their lives during the mutiny.</p>

<p>Lucknow is not far from Cawnpore, and here, too, the mutiny has
left its scars and monuments. The Lucknow residency, now an ivy
mantled ruin, was the scene of the great siege that lasted from the
first of July, 1857, to the seventeenth of November. At the beginning
there were within the walls nine hundred British troops and
officers, one hundred and fifty volunteers, seven hundred native troops,
six hundred women and children
and seven hundred non-combatant
natives; total,
about three thousand. When
relief came but one thousand
remained. The night before
the arrival of Sir Colin
Campbell with reinforcements,
one of the besieged,
a Scotch girl, dreamed of the
coming of relief, and her
dream gave rise to the song
so familiar a generation ago,

<p>There are in Lucknow a
number of tombs, mosques
and buildings that gave us
our first glimpse of the architecture
of the Mogul emperors&mdash;great
domes, gigantic
gateways and graceful minarets, stately columns and vaulted galleries.
The most interesting of the buildings, Imambarah, built by Asaf-ud-daulah,
contains a great hall more than a hundred and fifty feet long
and about fifty feet in breadth and height. On one side of the court
is a private mosque and on the other a group of apartments built
around a well as a protection against the summer's heat. From the
top of the Imambarah one obtains an excellent view of Lucknow and
its surroundings.</p>

<p>At Aligarh I found a great educational institution which must
be taken into consideration in estimating the future of Mohammedanism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
in India. It was founded in 1877, largely through the influence
and liberality of Sir Syed Ahmed, who until his death in 1898 devoted
himself entirely to its development. He was a large-minded man and
full of zeal for the enlightenment of his co-religionists. He recognized
the low intellectual standard of the Mohammedan Indians, and
the controlling purpose of his life was to assist in their improvement.
At first, his educational enterprise met with a cold reception at the
hands of the leaders
of his church. Emissaries
were even
sent from Mecca to
assassinate him, but,
nothing daunted, he
pursued his plans
until the church
authorities recognized
the importance
of the school.</p>

<p>As the Mohammedans
are numerically
weaker than the
Hindus and unable
to cope with them
in intellectual contests,
Sir Syed opposed
the national
congress proposition
which the Hindus
have long urged and
the Aligarh school
became conspicuous for its pro-British leanings on this question. This
may account in part for the interest taken in it by the colonial government.
(The Central Hindu College at Benares refuses government aid
and is, therefore, more independent.) But since the death of Sir Syed
the congress idea is growing among the students of Aligarh.</p>

<p>Aligarh College now has an enrollment of seven hundred and four,
more than a hundred of whom are law students. It has an English
Cambridge graduate for president and several English professors. I
might add that England, like America, has sent many teachers to
India, and that they are engaged in work, the importance of which
can not be overestimated. I had the pleasure of meeting those connected

<p>Delhi is one of India's most ancient cities. When the Aryans came
down from the northwest and conquered the aboriginal tribes, they
founded a city which they called Indrapat, just south of the present
site of Delhi. How old it is no one knows, for the names of its founders
have been forgotten, its records, if it had any, have been
destroyed, and its streets are winding footpaths which one follows
with difficulty. Every wave of invasion that has swept down from
the north or west has passed over Indrapat, and its stones would tell
a thrilling story if they could but speak. The city has been rebuilt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
again and again, the last time about three hundred years ago, but it
has little to exhibit now but its antiquity. There is a massive city
wall with huge gates, there are tumble-down buildings occupied by
a few people and
some goats, and there
is a stone library
building erected hundreds
of years before
Carnegie was born,
but the glory of
Indrapat has departed.
Not far from Indrapat
is the splendid
tomb of Humayun
and another of the
Asoka pillars.</p>

<p>Eleven miles south
of the present Delhi
is what is called old
Delhi (Delhi seems
to have had a movable
site) immortalized
by the famous
Kutab Minar, or
tower, erected near
the close of the
twelfth century by
one of the earliest Mohammedan conquerors after the capture of
Delhi. The tower&mdash;a tower of victory&mdash;is two hundred and thirty-eight
feet in height, forty-seven feet in diameter at the base and nine
at the top. It has been described as one of the architectural wonders
of the world, and it certainly gives one a profound respect for the
mind that planned it. There are so many mausoleums and mosques
scattered over the plains around Delhi that space forbids particular
description.</p>

<p>Within a century after the death of Mohammed the Moslems made
an attack upon India, but it was five hundred years later before they
became masters of the great peninsula. Then for five hundred more
it was the scene of conflict between rival Moslems until Timur (Tamerlan,
the Tartar) plundered it and drenched it with blood. In all
these wars Delhi was the strategic point, the natural capital of the
north. After Timur, came his descendant of the sixth generation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a><br /><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
Babar, who consolidated the Indian empire by bravery, tact and wisdom.
He is the first of the great Mogul rulers, but he was so occupied
with the extension of his sovereignty that he was compelled to leave
the development of the empire to his descendants. His grandson,
Akbar, built three great forts, one at Allahabad, to which reference
has been made in another article, another at Agra, which he made his
capital, and the third at Atok, still farther north. He also built Fatepur
Sikri about twenty miles from Agra. This was to be his home,
and here on a sandstone ridge overlooking the plain he reared a group
of buildings which even now, though deserted for two centuries,
attracts tourists from all over the world. While the material employed
is red sandstone, the buildings are models of beauty as well as strength,
and the minute and elaborate carvings are masterpieces in their line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>The fort built by Akbar at Agra, while not proof against modern
missiles, was impregnable in its day and still bears testimony to the
constructive genius of the second of the Moguls.</p>

<p>Six miles from Agra at Sikandra stands the magnificent tomb
which Akbar built and where he rests. It is constructed of red sandstone
and is part Buddhist and part Saracenic in design. The base is
three hundred and twenty feet square and its four retreating galleries
terminate in a roofless court of white marble in which stands a marble
casket surrounded by screens of marble most exquisitely carved. Special
interest is felt in the tomb because one of its ornaments was the
famous Kohinoor diamond, the largest in the world. It had come
down to Akbar from his grandfather, who in turn secured it from
the Rajputs. The diamond was carried away by Persian conquerors,
and later was returned to India only to be transferred to Queen Victoria.</p>

<p>But if Akbar surpassed his grandfather as a builder, he was in turn
surpassed by his grandson, Shah
Jehan. This emperor, the last of the
three great Moguls, who began his
career by murdering two brothers
and two cousins whose rivalry he
feared, and who closed his career a
prisoner of his rebellious son, has
linked his name with some of the
most beautiful structures ever conceived
by the mind of man. At
Agra within the walls of his grandfather's
fort, he built the Pearl
Mosque which has been described as
"the purest, loveliest house of prayer
in existence." It is constructed of
milk white marble and combines
strength, simplicity and grace. He
also built the Gem Mosque at Delhi.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">KLANJIBAN GANGULI, SUPT.

</div>

<p>The fort at Delhi was built by
Shah Jehan, and if its resemblance to
the fort at Agra deprives him of credit
for originality, that argument can
not be raised against the palace
within, for this is unrivaled among
palaces. The marble baths, the jeweled bed chambers, the pillared
halls, the graceful porticoes&mdash;all these abound in rich profusion. But
it was upon the great hall of Private Audience that he lavished taste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
and wealth. The floor is of polished marble, the pillars and
the arched ceiling of polished marble inlaid with precious stones,
so set as to form figures and flowers. Each square inch of it speaks
of patient toil and skill, and the whole blends harmoniously. For
this magnificent audience room he designed a throne fit for the
chamber in which it stood. "It was called the peacock throne because
it was guarded by two peacocks with expanded tails ornamented with
jewels that reproduced the natural colors of the bird. The throne
itself was made of gold, inlaid with diamonds, rubies and emeralds.
Over it was a canopy of gold festooned with pearls supported by
twelve pillars, all emblazoned with gems. On either side stood the
Oriental emblem of royalty, an umbrella, each handle eight feet
high and of solid gold, studded with diamonds, the covers being of
crimson velvet crusted and fringed with magnificent pearls." Thus it
was described. It was too tempting a prize for greedy conquerors to
leave undisturbed, and was carried off some centuries ago by a Persian,
Nadir Shah. Shah Jehan, after contemplating this audience
chamber and throne, had inscribed upon the wall in Persian characters
a verse which has been freely translated to read:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"If on earth be an Eden of bliss,</span>
<span class="i1">It is this, it is this, it is this."</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And yet, in view of his sad fate there seems as much irony in the
lines as there was in the delicately poised scales of justice which he
had inlaid on one of the walls of his palace after he had put his
relatives out of the way.</p>

<p>But of all the works of art that can be traced to his genius, nothing
compares with the tomb, the Taj Mahal, which he reared in honor
of the best-loved of his wives, Numtaj Mahal, "the chosen of the palace."
This building, unique among buildings and alone in its class,
has been described so often that I know not how to speak of it without
employing language already hackneyed. When I was a student at
college I heard a lecturer describe this wonderful tomb, and it was
one of the objective points in our visit to India. Since I first heard
of it I had read so much of it and had received such glowing accounts
from those who had seen it, that I feared lest the expectations aroused
might be disappointed. We reached Agra toward midnight, and, as
the moon was waning, drove at once to the Taj that we might see it
under the most favorable conditions, for in the opinion of many it is
most beautiful by moonlight. There is something fascinating in the
view which it thus presents, and we feasted our eyes upon it. Shrouded
in the mellow light, the veins of the marble and the stains of more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a><br /><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
than two and a half centuries are invisible, and it stands forth like
an apparition. We visited it again in the daytime, and yet again, and
found that the sunlight increased rather than diminished its grandeur.
I am bringing an alabaster miniature home with me, but I am conscious
that the Taj must be seen full size and silhouetted against the
sky to be appreciated.</p>

<p>Imagine a garden with flowers and lawn, walks and marble water
basins and fountains; in this garden build a platform of white marble
eighteen feet high and three hundred feet square, with an ornamented
minaret one hundred and thirty-seven feet high at each corner; in the
center of this platform rear a building one hundred and eighty feet
square and a hundred feet high, with its corners beveled off and, like
the sides, recessed into bays; surmount it with a large central dome
and four smaller ones; cover it inside and out with inlaid work of
many colored marbles and carvings of amazing delicacy; beneath the
central dome place two marble cenotaphs, inlaid with precious stones,
the tombs of Shah Jehan and his wife, and enclose them in exquisitely
carved marble screens&mdash;imagine all this, if you can, and then your
conception of this world-famed structure will fall far below the Taj
Mahal itself. It is, indeed, "a dream in marble." And yet, when one
looks upon it and then surveys the poverty and ignorance of the
women who live within its shadow, he is tempted to ask whether the
builder of the Taj might not have honored his wife more had the six
million dollars invested in this tomb been expended on the elevation
of womanhood. The contrast between this artistic pile and the miserable
tenements of the people about it robs the structure of half its
charms.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>

<h3>WESTERN INDIA.</h3>


<p>There is so much of interest in India that I find it difficult to condense
all that I desire to say into the space which it seems proper to
devote to this country. In speaking of the various cities, I have been
compelled to omit reference to the numerous industries for which
India is famed. Long before the European set foot upon the soil
the artisans had won renown in weaving, in carving and in brass. It
was, in fact, the very wealth of Indus that attracted the attention of the
western world and turned the prows of merchant vessels toward the
Orient. While India can complain that some of her arts have been
lost since she has been under the tutelage of foreigners, enough remains
to make every tourist a collector, to a greater or less extent, of
attractive souvenirs.</p>

<p>Benares is the center of the plain brass manufacture, and her bazaars
are full of vases, trays, candlesticks, bowls, etc. Lucknow is noted for
her silversmiths, but her products do not command so high a price
as those of southern India. Delhi leads in ivory and wood carving,
and one can find here the best specimens of this kind of work. Several
of the addresses presented to the Prince of Wales upon his recent
visit were encased in ivory caskets richly carved and studded with
gems. Painting on ivory is also carried to a high state of perfection
here, and sandalwood boxes can be found in all the stores.</p>

<p>At Agra one finds rugs woven in Turkish and Persian, as well as in
original, designs. Agra is also renowned for its inlaid work, many
of the designs of the Taj being copied. The Tag itself is reproduced
in miniatures at prices ranging from one dollar up into the hundreds.</p>

<p>In all the cities of upper India, Kashmir shawls may be secured,
Kashmir itself being far north of the line of travel. These shawls
are of goat's hair, and some of them are so delicate that though two
yards square, they can be drawn through a finger ring.</p>

<p>At Jaipore the chief industries which attract the attention of foreigners
are enameling on gold and brass, the latter being the best known.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
Few who visit the bazaars can resist the temptation to carry away some
samples of this ware, so graceful are the vessels and so skillful is the
workmanship.</p>

<p>Jaipore, the first of the western cities, and the only one of the native
states that we visited, is deserving of some notice, partly because it gives
evidence of considerable advancement and partly because the government
is administered entirely by native officials. The Maharaja is one
of the most distinguished of native princes and a descendant of the
famous Rajput line of kings. He lives in oriental style, has a number of
wives, and elephants, camels and horses galore. He is an orthodox
Hindu of the strictest type and drinks no water but the water of the
Ganges. When he went to England to attend the coronation, he chartered
a ship, took his retinue with him and carried Ganges water
enough to last until his return. He is very loyal to the British government
and in return he is permitted to exercise over his subjects
a power as absolute as the czar ever claimed. There is an English
resident at his capital, but his council is composed of Indians, his
judges are Indians, his collectors are Indians, his school teachers
are Indians, and he has an Indian army. I had the pleasure
of meeting one of the council and the head of the school system
of the state, and found them men of fine appearance and high culture.
The illiteracy in his state compares favorably with that in the states
under British administration, and the graduates from the Maharaja's
college compete successfully in the examinations with the graduates
from other colleges. They have at Jaipore an art school in which all
kinds of manual training are taught, and the sale-room of this school
gives accurate information as to the capacity of the natives for industrial
development. We found here the only native pottery of merit that we
noticed in the country.</p>

<p>The city of Jaipore was laid out in 1728 and is one of the most
attractive cities in India. The main streets are a hundred and ten feet
wide, the buildings are Oriental in style, most of them two stories in
height&mdash;some three&mdash;and all are painted the same shade of pink,
with white trimmings and green shutters. The entire city is supplied
with water and the streets are lighted by gas. All in all, Jaipore makes
a favorable impression upon the visitor.</p>

<p>Some six miles away is the ancient city of Amber, the capital of the
state until Jaipore was established. It is reached by a ride on elephant
back, the only ride of this kind that we have yet had. There is a beautiful
palace at Amber which gives some idea of the luxury in which the
Indian rulers lived. We returned from this trip late in the evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a><br /><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
when the peacocks were going to roost, and nearly every tree contained
one or more of these gaudy-plumaged fowls. These were apparently
wild, and their numbers and beauty recalled the fact that the peacock
is India's royal bird; and it is not an inappropriate symbol of the pomp
and magnificence of the Oriental kings. I might digress here to say
that the respect for life taught in the Hindu scriptures has filled India
to excess with useless birds and animals. The crows and kites are a
nuisance. It is no uncommon thing to see a vendor of cakes and sweetmeats
bearing his basket on his head and waving a stick above it to
scare off the birds. Sometimes an attendant follows the vendor and
protects him from the birds, but in spite of all precautions they get
their toll. The crows often come to the doors and windows of the hotels
and inquire whether you have any food to spare, and sparrows and
other small birds occasionally glean crumbs from the table. At Jaipore
we saw myriads of pigeons being fed in the streets, and monkeys&mdash;they
are everywhere. The jungles of the tropical countries are not more
thronged with them than the road sides of some parts of India. About
half way between Jaipore and Bombay they were especially numerous,
and as we rode along on the train we saw them singly, in groups and in
mass meetings. Here, too, we saw herds of antelope, scarcely frightened
by the train. Attention has frequently been called to the fact that the
Hindu's aversion to meat has a bearing upon the famine question, millions
of cattle dying of starvation which, if killed earlier, might have
saved thousands of human beings from starving.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><a name="jai" id="jai"></a>
<img src="images/ill131.jpg" width="600" height="347" alt="jai" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">STREET IN JAIPORE&mdash;INDIA</p></div>
</div>

<p>A night's ride from Jaipore brought us to Abu Road, from which by
pony carts, called tongas, we ascended to Mt. Abu, sixteen miles away.
The journey is made over a well kept mountain road which climbs to a
height of about five thousand feet. While this mountain resort draws
many Europeans because of its altitude, two famous Jain temples are
the lodestone that attracts tourists. These temples were built by merchant
princes in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, and the fact that
one of them cost more than five millions of dollars, shows that trade
had reached a commanding position in those days. One of the temples
was built by two brothers and the guide tells of a tradition that these
brothers, tiring of their money, decided to bury it, but on digging in
the earth they found more, and considering it a gift from the gods, built
this temple. The buildings are not large, and seen from the outside are
disappointing, but once within one marvels at the richness of the carving.
The pillars and vaulted ceilings are of the purest white marble,
brought from no one knows where, and every inch of the surface is covered
with figures of gods, human beings, animals, fowls and flowers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
The artists utilized the things with which the people were most familiar.
Here a frieze of elephant heads, the trunks joined, there a frieze of
geese, another of tigers or monkeys. In one dome maidens danced; in
another warriors fought; in a third flowers bloomed. The variety is
endless and the workmanship perfect. While the panels and friezes and
ceilings differ so much from each other, the arrangement is such that
they do not seem incongruous, but form a harmonious whole. The
Mohammedan conquerors mutilated some of the figures because of their
hatred of idolatry, and when, under Lord Curzon's administration, the
work of restoration was begun, it was impossible to find marble like the
original.</p>

<p>Around these temples are numerous shrines, each containing a seated
figure very much resembling Buddha. The Jains are a sect of the
Hindus, and their temples are renowned for their beauty. This temple
is visited by a large number of pilgrims every year, some of whom
were chanting their prayers while we were there.</p>

<p>Another night's ride and we were in Bombay, and what a luxury to
find a hotel constructed upon the American plan. The Taj Mahal is
the finest hotel in the Orient and would be a credit to any city in our
country. It was built by Mr. Tata, a rich Parsee, who planned it more
from public than from private considerations.</p>

<p>We found the plague increasing in virulence, three hundred having
died in the city the day before we arrived. Bombay has suffered terribly
from this scourge, twenty-four per cent having perished from it in the
last few days. Two years ago the American consul, Hon. William T. Fee,
lost his daughter and came near losing his wife by this dread disease,
and two of the European consuls have recently had to leave their homes
because of deaths among their native servants. With so many dying in
a single city (and ten thousand a week in the entire country), India
would seem an unsafe place to visit, and yet one would not know except
for the newspapers that an epidemic was raging, so little does it affect
business or social life. There is now in use a system of inoculation which
promises to materially lessen the mortality from this disease. A serum
is prepared in which the venom of serpents is the chief ingredient, and
this hypodermically administered has been found almost a sure preventive.
While the physicians are employing this remedy, the rat-catchers
are also busy, and about a thousand rodents are captured per day, it
having been demonstrated that the rat not only spreads the disease, but
carries a flea that imparts it by its bite.</p>

<p>Bombay is the Manchester of India, and the smokestacks of its many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
cotton factories give to the city a very business like appearance. These
mills are largely owned by Indians and operated by Indian capital.</p>

<p>On an island near Bombay
is one of the most frequented
of the rock-hewn temples,
called the Elephanta Caves.
This temple is chiseled out of
the solid rock, great pillars
being left to support the roof.
It is about one hundred and
thirty feet square by seventeen
in height and contains
a number of figures of heroic
size. These figures are carved
from the walls and represent
various gods and demons.
The Portuguese Christians,
several centuries ago, showed
their contempt for these gods
of stone by firing their cannon
into the temple. While
some of the pillars were battered
down and some of the
carvings mutilated, enough
now remains to show the impressiveness
of this ancient
place of worship.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">AN AMERICAN MAID IN PARSEE COSTUME.</p></div>
</div>

<p>No one can visit Bombay
without becoming interested
in a religious sect, the members
of which are known as
Parsees. They are few in
number, probably not exceeding a hundred thousand in the world, more
than half of whom live in or near Bombay. Theirs is the religion of
Zoroaster, and they contest with the Hebrews the honor of being the first
believers in one God. Their sacred books, the Zend-Avesta, are very
ancient, and the origin of their religion is placed anywhere from seven
hundred <small>B. C.</small> to three thousand <small>B. C.</small> They not only believe in one
God, but they believe in immortality and claim to have impressed their
ideas upon the Israelites when the latter were in bondage in Babylon.
The Parsees see in the world, as well as in the human being, a continuing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
conflict between right and wrong, and they regulate their conduct
by a high ethical system. When the Moslems swept over Persia and
made it one of the stars in Islam's crown, a band of Parsees preferred
migration to conversion, and, like our pilgrim fathers, sought a home in
a new country. In Bombay they have preserved their identity for some
nine centuries and have made themselves a potent influence in every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
department of the city's activity. They have their marriage ceremony,
their fire temples and their funeral rites. They have sometimes been
called fire worshipers and sun worshipers, but they simply regard fire
as the purest thing known and therefore accept it as a symbol of the invisible
god. Fire is kept burning in their temples, and when a new
temple is to be dedicated, fire is collected from the homes of persons
engaged in the principal industries and occupations, and this mingled
fire is used to kindle another fire and
this new fire another until the ninth
fire is lighted, and this becomes the altar
fire. Each fire is kindled without coming
in contact with the former one.</p>

<p>The Parsees have a peculiar form of
burial, which has come down from prehistoric
times. On Malabar Hill in the
suburbs of Bombay, overlooking the
sea, in the midst of a beautiful garden,
are their Towers of Silence. These are
large circular buildings twenty-five or
thirty feet high and without a roof.
Within the wall is a circular platform
sloping downward to a well in the center.
When a Parsee dies he is prepared
for burial and borne to this garden.
After the last rites have been performed
and the relatives and friends have taken
their farewell, the body is carried within
the tower by men appointed for the
purpose and placed naked upon this
platform. As soon as the corpse bearers
depart, the waiting vultures (of
which several hundred make their
home in the garden) swoop down upon
it and do not rise until the bones are
bare. The skeletons, sun-bleached, are
washed by the rains into the pit in the
center, where rich and poor, conspicuous
and obscure, mingle their dust together.
Every sanitary precaution is
taken and a fixed rate of five rupees is charged to all alike, the money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
being advanced from a burial fund where the family can not afford to
bear the expense.</p>

<p>The Parsees of Bombay, though they wear a dress peculiar to themselves,
are of all the Indians most like the Europeans and Americans.
We were in one Parsee home, and the furniture, the pictures and the
library were such as would be found in the average home in our country.
Statistics show that the percentage of education among the Parsees
is very much higher than among any other class of inhabitants,
and the women share the educational advantages with the men.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">ELEPHANT PARADE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The well-to-do Parsees have been conspicuous in philanthropy, endowing
colleges, hospitals and other charities. While they are counted
among the staunchest friends of British rule, they are also among the
most intelligent critics of the government's faults. Sir Pherosha M.
Mehta, the leading Parsee orator, is prominent in the national congress
movement. At a reception given at the hotel, and on other occasions,
we had an opportunity to meet a number of the Parsees, men and
women, priests and laymen, and found them abreast with the times
and alive to the problems with which the world is wrestling to-day.</p>

<p>I cannot close this article without mentioning the increasing presence
of American influence in Bombay. An American minister, Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
Mell, is pastor of the principal Methodist church, and the American
Congregationalists have a largely attended school for boys and girls
in the city. Many of the students were taken from famine-stricken
homes and are being educated with American money. There is also
here a school for the blind under American management, where the
students are not only taught to read and write, but trained in the
industries for which they are fitted.</p>

<p>I do not apologize for mentioning from time to time the institutions
which altruistic Americans have scattered over the Orient. If we can
not boast that the sun never sets on American territory, we can find
satisfaction in the fact that the sun never sets on American philanthropy;
if the boom of our cannon does not follow the Orb of Day in his
daily round, the grateful thanks of those who have been the beneficiaries
of American generosity form a chorus that encircles the globe.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

<h3>BRITISH RULE IN INDIA.</h3>


<p>"What is truth?" asked Pilate, and when he had asked the question
he went out without waiting for an answer. The question has been
asked many times and answered in many different ways. I was reminded
of a similar question when I read over the door of a court house
in Aligarh, India, the motto: "Justice is the Strength of the British
Empire." No empire, no government, no society can have any other
source of permanent strength. Lord Salisbury is quoted by Indian
leaders as saying: "Injustice will bring down the mightiest to ruin,"
and we all believe it. Wendell Phillips expressed it as strongly and even
more beautifully when he said (I quote from memory): "You may
build your capitals until they reach the skies, but if they rest upon
injustice, the pulse of a woman will beat them down."</p>

<p>But what is justice? How varied are the answers given! The subject,
in the name of justice, presents his appeal to his king, and the sovereign,
if he be a despot, may send him to exile or the prison or the block
and do it in the name of justice. What is justice? This question has
been ringing in my ears during our journey through India.</p>

<p>When I was a law student, I read the speech of Sheridan at the trial
of Warren Hastings, and that masterpiece of invective was recalled sixteen
years later, when a colonial policy began to be suggested in the
United States after the taking of Manila. I tried to inform myself in
regard to British rule in India; the more I read about it, the more unjust
it seemed. So many Americans have, however, during the last few
years spoken admiringly of England's colonial system that I have
looked forward to the visit to India with increasing interest, because of
the opportunity it would give me to study at close range a question of
vital importance to our own country. I have met some of the leading
English officials as well as a number in subordinate positions; have
talked with educated Indians&mdash;Hindus, Mohammedans and Parsees;
have seen the people, rich and poor, in the cities and in the country,
and have examined statistics and read speeches, reports, petitions and
other literature that does not find its way to the United States; and
British rule in India is far worse, far more burdensome to the people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
and far more unjust&mdash;if I understand the meaning of the word&mdash;than
I had supposed.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="earl" id="earl"></a>
<img src="images/ill137.jpg" width="400" height="535" alt="earl" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">HIS EXCELLENCY THE EARL OF MINTO.</p></div>
</div>

<p>When I say this I do not mean to bring an indictment against the
English people or to assert that they are guilty of intentional wrongdoing.
Neither do I mean to question the motives of those who are in
authority. It has been my good fortune to become personally acquainted
with Lord Minto, the present viceroy; with Lieutenant Governor Frazer,
the chief executive of the province of Bengal; with Lieutenant
Governor La Touche, chief executive of the United Provinces of Agra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
and Oudh, and with Governor Lamington, chief executive of the Bombay
presidency, three of the largest Indian states. These men, I am sure,
represent the highest type of their countrymen. Lord Minto is fresh
from Canada, where he was governor general; Governor Lamington was
the head of the Australian government before coming to India, and both
Governors Frazer and La Touche have long official experience to their
credit. That they will be just, as they understand justice, and do right
as they see the right, I am satisfied. But what is justice?</p>

<p>The trouble is that England acquired India for England's advantage,
not for India's, and that she holds India for England's benefit, not for
India's. She administers India with an eye single to England's interests,
not India's, and she passes upon every question as a judge would
were he permitted to decide his own case. The officials in India owe
their appointment directly or indirectly to the home government, and
the home government holds authority at the sufferance of the people of
England, not of the people of India. The official who goes out
from England to serve a certain time and then return, whose interests
are in England rather than in India and whose sympathies are naturally
with the British rather than with the natives, can not be expected
to view questions from the same standpoint as the Indians.
Neither can these officials be expected to know the needs of the people
as well as those who share their daily life and aspirations.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to review the earlier rule under the East India
Company; that is sufficiently condemned by public record. That company
was chartered for commercial purposes, and its rule had no other
than a pecuniary aim. It secured control of state after state by helping
one native prince against another where it did not actually instigate
war between princes. The English government finally took the colony
over, confessedly because of the outrageous conduct of the company's
officials. No one now defends the rule of the East India Company,
although Warren Hastings was finally acquitted by the House of Lords
in spite of his crimes, out of consideration for his public service in extending
English authority.</p>

<p>Is English rule in India just, as we find it to-day? Fortunately, England
permits free speech in England, although she has sometimes
restricted it in her colonies, and there has not been a public question
under consideration in England for a century which has not brought
out independent opinion. It is the glory of England that she was an
early champion of freedom of speech, and it is the glory of Englishmen
that they criticise their own government when they think it wrong.
During the American revolution, Burke thundered his defense of the
rights of the colonists, and Walpole warned his countrymen that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
could not destroy American liberty without asserting principles which,
if carried out, would destroy English liberty as well. During the recent
war in South Africa the British had no more severe critics than were to
be found among her own people and in her own parliament. And so,
to-day, British rule in India is as forcibly arraigned by Englishmen as
by the Indians themselves. While Mr. Naoroji, an Indian, goes to England
and secures from a meeting of a radical club the adoption of a
resolution reciting that as "Britain has appropriated thousands of millions
of India's wealth for building up and maintaining her British Indian
empire and for drawing directly vast wealth to herself;" that as
"she is continuing to drain about thirty million pounds sterling of
India's wealth every year unceasingly in a variety of ways" and that as
"she has thereby reduced the bulk of the Indian population to extreme
poverty, destitution and degradation, it is therefore her bounden duty,
in common justice and humanity, to pay from her own exchequer the
costs of all famines and diseases caused by such impoverishment." And
further, "that it is most humiliating and discreditable to the British
name that other countries should be appealed to or should have to come
to Britain's help for relief of Britain's own subjects, and after and by
her un-British rule of about one hundred and fifty years."</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="vice" id="vice"></a>
<img src="images/ill138.jpg" width="400" height="244" alt="vice" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">VICEROY'S PALACE AT CALCUTTA.</p></div>
</div>

<p>While, I repeat, Mr. Naoroji was securing the unanimous adoption of
the above resolution in England, Sir Henry Cotton, now a member of
parliament, but for thirty-five years a member of the Indian civil service,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
was preparing his book, New India, in which he courageously points
out the injustice from which India now suffers. Neither he nor Mr.
Naoroji suggests Indian independence. Both believe that English sovereignty
should continue, but Mr. Cotton shows the wrongs now inflicted
upon India and the necessity for reform. Not only does he charge
that the promises of the queen have been ignored and Indians excluded
from service for which they were fitted, but he charges that the antagonism
between the officials and the people is growing and that there is
among civilian magistrates "an undoubted tendency to inflict severe
sentences when natives of India are concerned, and to impose light and
sometimes inadequate punishment upon offenders of their own race,"
and that in trials "in which Englishmen are tried by English juries"
the result is sometimes "a failure of justice not falling short of judicial
scandal." If justice can not be found in the court, where shall she be
sought?</p>

<p>After the Indian mutiny, the Queen, in a proclamation, promised that
natives should be freely and impartially admitted to offices, "the duties
of which they might be qualified by their education, ability and integrity
to discharge." Lord Lytton, a viceroy of India, in a confidential
document which afterward found its way into print, speaking of the
pledges of the sovereign and the parliament of England, said: "We all
know that these claims and expectations never can be fulfilled. We have
had to choose between prohibiting them (the natives of India) and
cheating them, and we have chosen the least straightforward course."
And again: "Since I am writing confidentially, I do not hesitate to say
that both the governments of England and of India appear to me, up
to the present moment, unable to answer satisfactorily the charge of
having taken every means in their power of breaking to the heart the
words of promise they had uttered to the ear."</p>

<p>The government of India is as arbitrary and despotic as the government
of Russia ever was, and in two respects it is worse. First, it is
administered by an alien people, whereas the officials of Russia are
Russians. Second, it drains a large part of the taxes out of the country,
whereas the Russian government spends at home the money which it
collects from the people. A third disadvantage might be named since
the czar has recently created a legislative body, whereas England continues
to deny to the Indians any form of representative or constitutional
government. Under British rule there is no official corruption
and the government is probably as impartial as an alien government
can be expected to be, but British rule has the defects which are inherent
in a colonial policy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>The people of India are taxed, but they have no voice in the amount
to be collected or in the use to be made of the revenue. They pay into
the government nearly two hundred and twenty-five millions of dollars
a year, and of this nearly one hundred millions is expended upon an
army in which Indians can not be officers. It is not necessary to keep
such an army merely to hold the people in subjection, if the Indians
are really satisfied with English rule; and if the army is intended to
keep Russia from taking India, as is sometimes claimed, why should
not the British government bear a part of the burden? Would it not be
wiser to so attach the Indian people to the British government that they
would themselves resist annexation to Russia?</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 350px;"><a name="diggs" id="diggs"></a>
<img src="images/ill139.jpg" width="350" height="502" alt="diggs" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">SIR JAMES DIGGS LA TOUCHE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The home charges, as they are called, absorb practically one-third of
the entire revenues. About one hundred million dollars go out of India<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
to England every year, and over fifteen millions are paid to European
officials in the civil employ. What nation could stand such a drain
without impoverishment?</p>

<p>Taxation is nearly twice as heavy in India as in England, in proportion
to the income of the people. Compared with the people of other
countries, the Indian's income is, on an average, one-twentieth of the
average English income, one-seventh of the average Spaniard's income,
one-sixth of the average Italian's income, one-fifth of the (European)
Russian's income, and one-half of the income of the Turk. Sir Henry
Cotton shows that the average per capita deposit in banks in England
is one hundred dollars while the average per capita deposit in India is
fifty cents; but how can the Indian be expected to have a large bank account
when the average yearly income is only ten dollars? I have, in
another article, referred to the jewelry worn by Indian women. The
bracelets and anklets are silver except among the poorest, and this was
formerly a form of hoarding, but the suspension of the coinage of silver
deprived the people of the privilege of converting this hoarded silver
into rupees. It will be remembered that the late Senator Wolcott,
a member of the monetary commission appointed by President
McKinley in 1897, on his return to Europe declared that the suspension
of the coinage of silver in India had reduced the value of the
savings of the people to the amount of five hundred millions of dollars.
The suspension was carried out for the benefit of European
interests, regardless of the welfare of the masses.</p>

<p>So great have been the drain, the injustice to the people and the tax
upon the resources of the country, that famines have increased in frequency
and severity. Mr. Gokhale, one of the ablest of India's public
men, presided over the meeting of the last Indian national congress
(held in December) and declared in his opening speech that the death
rate had steadily risen from twenty-four to the thousand in 1882-4 to
thirty in 1892-4 and to thirty-four at the present time. I have more
than once within the last month heard the plague referred to as a providential
remedy for over-population! Think of it, British rule justified
because "it keeps the people from killing each other" and the plague
excused because it removes those whom the government has saved from
slaughter!</p>

<p>The railroads with all their advantages have been charged with adding
to the weight of famine by carrying away the surplus grain in good
years, leaving no residue for the years of drouth. While grain can now
be carried back more easily in times of scarcity, the people are too poor
to buy it with two freights added. The storage of grain by the government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
at central points until the new crop is safe would bring some relief,
but it has not been attempted.</p>

<p>If it is argued that the railroads have raised the price of grain in
the interior by furnishing a cheaper outlet to the sea, it must be
remembered that the benefit has accrued not to the people, nearly all
of whom are tenants, but to the landlords, the government being the
largest holder.</p>

<p>Not only are the people
being impoverished, but the
land is being worn out. Manure,
which ought to be
used to renew the fields, is
consumed as fuel, and no
sight is more common in
India than that of women
and children gathering manure
from the roads with
their hands. This, when
mixed with straw and sun-dried,
is used in place of
wood, and from the amount
of it carried in baskets, it
must be one of the chief articles
of merchandise. There
are now large tracts of useless
land that might be
brought under cultivation
if the irrigation system were
extended. Proof of this is
to be found in the fact that
the government of India
has already approved of extensions
which, when made,
will protect seven million
acres and irrigate three
million acres. The estimated
cost of these extensions is about forty-five million dollars,
and the plans are to be carried out "as funds can be provided."
Ten per cent of the army expenditure, applied to irrigation, would
complete the system within five years, but instead of military expenses
being reduced, the army appropriation was increased more than ten
million dollars between 1904 and 1905.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the total amount raised from taxation each year, about forty per
cent is raised from land, and the rate is so heavy that the people can not
save enough when the crops are good to feed themselves when the crops
are bad. More than ten per cent of the total tax is collected on salt,
which now pays about five-eighths of a cent per pound. This is not only
a heavy rate when compared with the original cost of the salt; but it is
especially burdensome to the poor. The salt tax has been as high as
one cent a pound, and when at that rate materially reduced the amount
of salt consumed by the people.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="curzon" id="curzon"></a>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>The poverty of the people of India is distressing in the extreme; millions
live on the verge of starvation all the time, and one would think
that their very appearance would plead successfully in their behalf.</p>

<p>The economic wrong done to the people of India explains the political
wrong done to them. For more than twenty years an Indian national
congress has been pleading for a modified form of representative
government&mdash;not for a severing of the tie that binds India to Great
Britain, but for an increasing voice in their local affairs. But this
request can not be granted. Why? Because a local government, composed
of natives selected by the people, would protest against so large
an army, reduce the taxes and put Indians at lower salaries into places
now held by Europeans. It is the fear of what an Indian local government
would do that prevents the experiment, although two other reasons,
both insufficient, are given. One of these is that the Indian
people are not intelligent enough and that they must be protected from
themselves by denying them a voice in their own affairs. The other is
that the Indians are so divided into tribes and religious sects that they
can not act harmoniously together. The first argument will not impress
any unprejudiced traveler who has come into contact with the educated
classes. There are enough well informed, college trained native Indians,
not to speak of those, who, like our own ancestors a few centuries ago,
have practical sense and good judgment without book learning, to guide
public opinion. While the percentage of literacy is deplorably small,
the total number of educated men is really considerable, and there are
at this time seventeen thousand students above the secondary schools
and studying for the B. A. degree. There is not a district of any considerable
size that has not some intelligent men in it, and these could be
relied upon to direct the government until a larger number are qualified
to assist. It is true that native princes have often seemed indifferent
to the welfare of their subjects&mdash;Princes who have lived in great luxury
while the people have been neglected, but to-day some of the native
states vie with those controlled by European officials in education and
material advancement. And is not the very fact that the people are left
under the government of native princes in the native states conclusive
proof that in all the states the government could be administered without
the aid of so large a number of Europeans?</p>

<p>The second argument is equally unsound. To say that the Indians
would necessarily fight among themselves is to ignore the progress of the
world. There was a time when Europe was the scene of bloody religious
wars, and our own country is indebted to the persecution of the
pilgrims in England for some of its best pioneers. There has been a
growth in religious tolerance during the last century, and this is as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
noticeable in India as elsewhere. Already the intellectual leaders of
all the sects and elements of the Indian population are mingling in congresses,
conferences and public meetings. Already a national spirit is
growing which, like the national spirit in England and America, disregards
religious lines and emphasizes more and more the broad social
needs which are common to all; and with the increase of general education
there will be still more of unity and national sentiment. Those
who make this argument also forget that as long as England maintains
sovereignty it will be impossible for religious differences to lead to war
and that differences in council and in congress would strengthen rather
than weaken her position.</p>

<p>But why is there a lack of intelligence among the Indians? Have
they not had the blessings of British rule for several generations? Why
have they not been fitted for self-government? Gladstone, whose greatness
of head and heart shed a lustre upon all Europe, said: "It is liberty
alone which fits men for liberty. This proposition, like every other
in politics, has its bounds; but it is far safer than the counter doctrine,
'wait till they are fit.'"</p>

<p>How long will it take to fit the Indians for self-government when
they are denied the benefits of experience? They are excluded from
the higher civil service (ostensibly open to them) by a cunningly devised
system of examinations which makes it almost impossible for
them to enter. Not only are the people thus robbed of opportunities
which rightfully belong to them, but the country is deprived of the
accumulated wisdom that would come with service, for the alien officials
return to Europe at the end of their service, carrying back their wisdom
and earnings, not to speak of the pensions which they then begin to
draw.</p>

<p>The illiteracy of the Indian people is a disgrace to the proud nation
which has for a century and a half controlled their destiny. The editor
of the Indian World, a Calcutta magazine, says in last February's
number:</p>

<p>"If India has not yet been fit for free institutions, it is certainly not
her fault. If, after one and a half centuries of British rule, India remains
where she was in the Middle Ages, what a sad commentary must
it be upon the civilizing influences of that rule! When the English
came to India, this country was the leader of Asiatic civilization and
the undisputed center of light in the Asiatic world; Japan was then
nowhere. Now, in fifty years, Japan has revolutionized her history
with the aid of modern arts of progress and India, with an hundred
and fifty years of English rule, is still condemned to tutelage."</p>

<p>Who will answer the argument presented by this Indian editor?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
And he might have made it stronger. Japan, the arbiter of her own
destiny and the guardian of her own people, has in half a century
bounded from illiteracy to a position where ninety per cent of her
people can read and write and is now thought worthy to enter into
an Anglo-Japanese alliance, while India, condemned to political servitude,
and sacrificed for the commercial advantage of another nation,
still sits in darkness, less than one per cent of her women able to read
and write and less than ten per cent of her total population sufficiently
advanced to communicate with each other by letter or to gather knowledge
from the printed page. In the speech above referred to, Mr.
Gokhale estimates that four villages out of every five are without a
school house, and this, too, in a country where the people stagger under
an enormous burden of taxation. The published statement for 1904-5
shows that the general government appropriated but six and a half
million dollars for education while more than ninety millions were
appropriated for "army service," and the revised estimate for the next
year shows an increase of a little more than half a million for education
while the army received an increase of more than twelve millions.</p>

<p>The government has, it is true, built a number of colleges (with
money raised by taxation), but it is gradually extending the system
of primary and secondary schools (also with taxes), though the progress
is exceedingly slow and the number of schools grossly inadequate.
Benevolent Englishmen have also aided the cause of education by establishing
private schools and colleges under church and other control,
but the amount returned to India in this way is insignificant when
compared with the amount annually drawn by England from India.</p>

<p>It is not scarcity of money that delays the spread of education in
India, but the deliberate misappropriation of taxes collected, and the
system which permits this disregard of the welfare of the subjects and
the subordination of their industries to the supposed advancement of
another nation's trade is as indefensible upon political and economic
grounds as upon moral grounds. If more attention were given to
the intellectual progress of the people and more regard shown for their
wishes, it would not require so many soldiers to compel loyalty to
England, neither would it require a large army to preserve peace and
order. If agriculture were protected and encouraged and native industries
built up and diversified, England's commerce with India would
be greater, for prosperous people would buy more than can be sold
to India to-day, when so many of her sons and daughters are like
walking shadows.</p>

<p>Lord Curzon, the most brilliant of India's viceroys of recent years,
inaugurated a policy of reaction. He not only divided Bengal with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a><br /><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>view of lessening the political influence of the great province, but
he adopted an educational system which the Indians believe was intended
to discourage higher education among the native population.
The result, however, was exactly the opposite of that which was intended.
It aroused the Indians and made them conscious of the
possession of powers which they had not before employed. As the cold
autumn wind scatters winged seeds far and wide, so Lord Curzon's
administration spread the seeds of a national sentiment, and there
is more life in India to-day, and therefore more hope, than there has
ever been before. So high has feeling run against the government
that there has been an attempted boycott of English made goods, and
there is now a well organized movement to encourage the use of goods
made in India.</p>

<p>Let no one cite India as an argument in defense of colonialism.
On the Ganges and the Indus the Briton, in spite of his many noble
qualities and his large contributions to the world's advancement, has
demonstrated, as many have before, man's inability to exercise, with
wisdom and justice, irresponsible power over helpless people. He has
conferred some benefits upon India, but he has extorted a tremendous
price for them. While he has boasted of bringing peace to the living,
he has led millions to the peace of the grave; while he has dwelt
upon order established between warring tribes, he has impoverished
the country by legalized pillage. Pillage is a strong word, but no refinement
of language can purge the present system of its iniquity.
How long will it be before the quickened conscience of England's Christian
people will heed the petition that swells up from fettered India
and apply to Britain's greatest colony the doctrines of human brotherhood
that have given to the Anglo-Saxon race the prestige it now
enjoys?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span>&mdash;The article on British Rule in India has been severely criticized by the
government papers in India and as heartily praised by prominent representatives
of the native population. Delegations of Indians called upon me in London, Paris
and New York to express their thanks.</p>

<p>In view of this criticism, I give below a few facts in support of the views
expressed in the article.</p></blockquote>

<p>In Whitaker's Almanac for 1906 (published in London), the appropriation
for education is given at 1,298,000 pounds in 1902-3, 1,368,000
pounds in 1903-4, and 1,474,000 pounds in 1904-5. The appropriation
for army services is given at 17,346,000 pounds for 1902-3,
17,892,000 pounds for 1903-4, and 20,463,000 pounds for 1904-5.
(The figures for 1904-5 are described as "revised estimates" in both
cases.) Multiplying the pounds by five, it will be seen that the appropriation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
for education is about seven million dollars and the appropriation
for army services (for the last year) about one hundred
and two millions. What defense can be made for the expenditure of
more than thirteen times as much for the army as for education?</p>

<p>Within a few days after the publication of my article, Hon. John
Morley, Secretary for India, delivered a speech in Parliament upon
the Indian budget. The following quotations show that he has made
the same criticism
on three important
matters. First, on
the salt tax. He
says:</p>

<p>"But for my part
I cannot regard, and
I will not regard
with satisfaction, or
even with patience,
the continuance at a
high scale of a tax
on a prime necessity
of life. (Cheers.)"</p>

<p>And again:</p>

<p>"It is not that the
Indian is more heavily
burdened in the
matter of the salt
duty than the Italian.
But, however
that may be, I am
glad to think that
the very able and expert
financial member
of the Viceroy's
council hopes to
make further reduction in the duty, even though he cannot go so far
as I should like to go, and sweep the thing away altogether. (Cheers.)"</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 350px;"><a name="indian" id="indian"></a>
<img src="images/ill143.jpg" width="350" height="529" alt="indian" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">INDIAN STUDENTS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>On the expenditure for the army, he says:</p>

<p>"So far, I have given a rose-colored&mdash;I hope a true colored&mdash;picture.
In military expenditure, however, we have the shadow. Comparing
broadly 1906-7 with the figures of ten years ago, there is an increase
in the strength of the army of four thousand one hundred and forty
seven men. In 1896-7 the number was two hundred and twenty-seven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
thousand men and in 1906-7, two hundred and thirty-one thousand
five hundred men. But the remarkable circumstance comes out that
in British cavalry and infantry there is no increase. The only important
addition to the fighting strength of the army are an increase
in our artillery and an increase in the number of British officers to the
tune of one thousand. That is a large and costly addition, but I will not
argue it now. The net army expenditure in India, British and native, in
1896-7, was fifteen million pounds; the estimate for 1906-7 is eighteen
million seven hundred thousand pounds&mdash;an increase of three million
seven hundred thousand pounds. (This is an estimate of the net
expenditure, the Whitaker estimate is gross.) This has to be divided
into two equal items of one million eight hundred and fifty thousand
pounds for ordinary and special military expenditure. I invite the
House to attend to one element in the increase in the ordinary expenditure.
The House will remember that the late government found
it necessary to grant additional pay to the non-commissioned officers
and men in the British army in India. Those were circumstances
for which neither the Government nor the governed in India had a
shadow of responsibility. They were not responsible for those social
circumstances which made it necessary to add to the pay of the British
soldier, but the increase of pay in the British contingent of the Indian
military force was saddled on India to the tune of nearly a million
sterling."</p>

<p>On higher civil service he confesses the injustice done the Indians.
He says:</p>

<p>"In regard to the question of the employment of Indians in the
higher offices, I think a move&mdash;a definite and deliberate move&mdash;ought
to be made with the view of giving competent and able natives the
same access to the higher posts in the administration that are given
to our own countrymen. (Cheers.) There is a famous sentence in
the Queen's proclamation of 1858 which says:&mdash;'It is our further will
that, so far as may be, our subjects, of whatever race or creed, be freely
and impartially admitted to offices in our service-offices, the duties of
which they may be qualified by their educational talents and ability
duly to discharge.' I think those words, 'so far as may be,' have been
somewhat misinterpreted in the past. I do not believe that the ministers
who advised Queen Victoria in framing one of the most memorable
documents in all our history meant those words to be construed
in a narrow, literal, restricted or pettifogging sense. (Cheers.) I do
not believe that parliament ever intended this promise of the Queen's
should be construed in any but a liberal and generous sense. The
Governor-General of India to-day is, I am glad to say, a man of a firm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
texture of mind. I do not believe the Governor-General has any
intention of riding off on a narrow interpretation of a promise which
was as wise and politic as it was just. (Hear, hear.) I do not know
if there is any case in history of an autocratic, personal or absolute
government co-existing with free speech and free right of meeting.
For as long a time as my poor imagination can pierce through, for
so long a time our government in India must partake, and in no small
degree, of the personal and absolute element. But that is no reason
why we should not try this great experiment of showing that you
can have a strong and effective administration along with free speech
and free institutions, and being all the better and all the more effective
because of free speech and free institutions. (Cheers.) That policy
is a noble one to think of, but the task is arduous; and because it is
noble and because it is arduous, I recommend the policy, of which I
have only given a broad outline, to the adoption of the House."
(Cheers.)</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>

<h3>ANCIENT EGYPT.</h3>


<p>We have been moving among the oldest monuments reared by man,
and they make the rest of the world seem young. In Japan a Buddhist
temple, built twelve hundred years ago, impressed us with the
youthfulness of American institutions; in China we were shown temples
that had stood for twenty centuries and were told of customs
and laws even older; in India we found a pagoda some twenty-five
hundred years old, and visited the site of a city whose foundations
were probably laid more than three thousand years ago; but here we
see the mummied forms of human beings who lived two thousand
years before Christ was born, inspect the handiwork of men who
laid down the chisel before Abraham appeared upon the earth, look
upon colors that have withstood the changes and defied the elements
of forty centuries, and handle wheat that grew upon the banks of the
Nile long before Joseph built granaries for Pharaoh. The guides
count centuries as trippingly on the tongue as a treasury expert or an
insurance magnate handles millions. They discuss dynasties that
rose and fell when Europe was shrouded in darkness, before the light
of history dawned upon the Ganges and the Yangtse; they decipher
hieroglyphics that kept their secrets for ages and lead one among
ruins that astonish by their immensity as well as by the artistic skill
which they reveal.</p>

<p>Back in the misty past&mdash;in the prehistoric period&mdash;there were two
Egyptian kingdoms, one occupying upper, and the other lower Egypt.
This was prior to 2,500 <small>B. C.</small>, and from the stirring scenes engraved
upon stone, one can imagine the conflicts which took place along the
fertile valley of the Nile before Menes, the earliest known ruler, united
the two kingdoms, assumed the title, Lord of Both Lands, fashioned
a double crown for himself, and adopted the lily, or lotus, and the
papyrus as symbols of his consolidated empire. We are probably
indebted to certain natural peculiarities of Egypt for the preservation
of the unique evidences of ancient civilization found here. First,
there is but a small area of tillable land stretched along the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
wonderful of rivers and guarded on either side by a barren waste that
offers greater protection than a wall. Second, the climate of Egypt is
dry, and there are no drenching rains to deface and no violent changes
of temperature to disintegrate. Third, the temples and tombs are
so massively built as to discourage the vandal; and fourth, the sands
of the desert have drifted in and concealed for a hundred generations
many of the most valuable of these relics of a bygone age.</p>

<p>There is such a wealth of archæological treasures here that one
scarcely knows where to begin or how to condense the most important
things into the space allotted to a newspaper article. I shall not attempt
to describe things chronologically, because some of the temples
have been added to by different kings and dynasties, until they represent
the art and life of many hundred years. The temple at Karnak,
for instance, bears the impress of Egypt's rulers from Thutmosis to
the Rameses, and from the Rameses to the Ptolemies, a period of some
twelve hundred years, and the building of the numerous pyramids
covered even a longer time.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="karnak" id="karnak"></a>
<img src="images/ill145.jpg" width="450" height="239" alt="karnak" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">KARNAK TEMPLE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>As the tourist usually begins a trip through Egypt with a visit
to Cairo, he is likely to find the great Egyptian museum, the Museum
of Gizeh, a fitting introduction to his subsequent investigations. Here
one finds samples of all the antiquities of the country, excepting the
pyramids and the temples, and there are mummies, sarcophagi, statues,
carvings and hieroglyphics from these. A considerable space is devoted
to mummies, some from the tombs of kings, but many of more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
humble rank. The early Egyptians believed that man was composed
of several different entities. First, there was the body, and second,
the double&mdash;a sort of invisible form reproducing the features of the
body. Next came the soul, represented as a human-headed bird and
then a spark of the divine fire called Khu, which has been translated
as "the Luminous." It was to prevent the departure of these attending
forms that embalming was resorted to. By suspending the decomposition
of the body, they thought that they could preserve the connection
between it and the Double, the Soul and the Luminous, and
by prayers and offerings these could be saved from the second death.
This is the explanation of the mummy given by archæologists. The
Double, it was supposed, never left the place where the mummy
rested, and the Soul, while it went away to commune with the gods,
returned from time to time, and for this reason rooms were made
for the reception of the Soul and for the habitation of the Double.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
One can hardly believe as he looks upon the shriveled forms that
they were interred so long ago. I will enclose with this article a
photograph of the mummy of Egypt's great builder, and known as
"the Pharaoh of the Oppression," who died more than three thousand
years ago. The hand no longer sways the scepter; the eyes look
no more upon the gigantic statues which he scattered along the Nile,
and the voice does not now demand the making of "bricks without
straw," but the mortal remains of this famous ruler vividly recall the
days of Israel's bondage.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 300px;"><a name="mummy" id="mummy"></a>
<img src="images/ill146.jpg" width="300" height="420" alt="mummy" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">MUMMY.<br />
WOODEN STATUE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>With the mummies are many mummy cases, some covered with
hieroglyphics, some ornamented with pictures in colors, and most
of them covered with a lid upon which are a face mask and an outline
of the form of the occupant. The process by which these bodies have
been preserved is still a mystery, but the fact that they have outlived
dynasties and survived the countless changes of so many centuries
gives to them a lasting interest. The collection of statues and images
of gods, human beings, beasts and birds runs up into the thousands.
Some of these are heroic in size, others are not more than an inch
in height; some are strong, some beautiful and some grotesque. Granite,
both red and black, alabaster, stone, iron, bronze and clay&mdash;all
have been brought into requisition for this work. Some of the bronze
has, upon analysis, been found to contain practically the same combination
of metals as the bronze now used. There are even statues
in wood, and one of these&mdash;a photograph of which I secured&mdash;attracted
my attention because the head and face bear a resemblance to the
late Senator Hanna. It is called "Sheikh el Beled" or Village Chief;
that it should have resisted decay for more than forty centuries is little
less than marvelous.</p>

<p>While the excavators have been searching for historical records,
they have occasionally found treasures of great pecuniary value. A
considerable quantity of gold and silver in the form of jewelry has
been unearthed, and the museum contains specimens of exquisite
workmanship which not only display the skill of the artificers but
portray the habits and customs of the early Egyptians.</p>

<p>The museum also contains enough of cloth, found with the mummies,
and of pictures of looms, to show that weaving was an industry
with which the people of those days were familiar.</p>

<p>But we must leave the museum and proceed to those masterpieces
which are too large for any roof, save that formed by the vaulted
skies. I am, however, constrained to offer one criticism of the museum
in passing. It is under the control of a French society, and the only
catalogue obtainable is printed in French. While most of the exhibits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
bear a brief description in both French and English, some are
labeled in French only and a few not at all. As there are no guides
to show a visitor through the numerous rooms and point out the
principal objects of interest, those who are unable to read French are
at a great disadvantage. Considering the number of English and
American tourists it seems strange that more attention should not
be paid to their accommodation.</p>

<p>But to the temples. We reached Egypt after the regular tourist
season was over and could not visit all the ruins. We selected the
most famous, those of the two ancient cities, Thebes and Memphis, and
they alone would repay a visit to Egypt. The present city of Luxor,
four hundred and twenty miles from Cairo, covers a small part of
the vast area once occupied by "Hundred-gated Thebes." In the very
heart of the city a mammoth temple has been found where kings worshiped
through many reigns. It was built during the eighteenth
dynasty (<small>B. C.</small> 1500) on the site of a still older sanctuary and dedicated
to Ammon, his wife, Mut, and their son, Khons, the Moon-god.
Some of the columns are twelve feet in diameter, more than forty feet
in height, and support great blocks of red granite twenty feet long
and four feet in width and thickness. Some of the columns represent
clustered papyrus and have capitals shaped like the lotus bud. In the
temple are a number of statues of Rameses II, some sitting, some
standing. One of these statues is forty-five feet in height, and
another of less dimensions was unearthed only about a year ago.
When excavations were begun houses were serenely resting on the top
of the temple, and it is believed that further excavations will disclose
an avenue leading to other temples two miles away.</p>

<p>In front of the Luxor temple is an obelisk of pink granite, a part
of which is still under ground. Obelisks were always erected in
pairs, and the companion of this one was removed some years ago to
Paris. These great monoliths come down to us from the period when
the Egyptians worshiped the sun, and they were intended to represent
his rays. The oldest Egyptian obelisk is at Heliopolis, not
far from Cairo, and is sixty-six feet in height. It is supposed to have
been erected 2000 to 2200 <small>B. C.</small>, but it is in an excellent state of
preservation and bids fair to bear testimony for ages yet to the reverence
felt by the ancients for the sun. At one time Heliopolis was a
thriving city and is referred to in the Bible as "On," but to-day the
obelisk stands alone in the midst of cultivated fields, all the buildings
having disappeared.</p>

<p>While the obelisk at Heliopolis outranks all others in age, the one
at Karnak, in the suburbs of Luxor, has the distinction of being the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
tallest one yet remaining. It is eight and a half feet in diameter at
the base and ninety-seven and a half feet in height (eight and a
half feet less than the obelisk at Rome). The obelisks were cut in
a single shaft, most of them from granite quarries near Assuan.
These quarries are more than five hundred miles south of Cairo,
and it is supposed that the obelisks were transported on the Nile to
the places where they have since been found, but how they were handled
or placed in position no one knows.</p>

<p>The temple of Ammon, at Karnak, is generally regarded as the
most interesting of temple-ruins in Egypt. It is the work of many
kings, one adding a sanctuary, another a pylon, another a court, etc.&mdash;each
placing his cartouche, or seal, upon his work. This temple,
which was officially styled the Throne of the World, covers an immense
area. One pylon, or gateway, is more than three hundred
feet wide, nearly a hundred and fifty feet high, and has walls sixteen
feet thick. One court covers almost a thousand square yards, and
one aisle leads between pillars sixty-nine feet in height, about twelve
feet in diameter and supporting capitals of eleven feet. The stones
used in this temple are of enormous size, and they were probably raised
to their positions on scaffolding of earth&mdash;this being also the method
employed where attempts have recently been made to restore fallen
columns.</p>

<p>The hieroglyphics upon the walls, the columns, the obelisks and
the statues, after remaining a puzzle for ages, have been deciphered
and woven into a consecutive history. This was made possible by the
discovery, in 1799, of what is known as the "Rosetta stone" (now in the
British Museum) at the mouth of the Rosetta arm of the Nile by a
French engineer named Bouchard. This stone bears a decree inscribed
in three languages&mdash;ancient Egyptian, modern Egyptian and Greek,
and furnishes the key to unlock the secrets of ancient history.</p>

<p>The pictures represent sacrificial ceremonies, domestic and industrial
scenes, battles, triumphal processions&mdash;all phases of life, in fact.
One wall contains, in hieroglyphics, the treaty of peace which Rameses
II concluded with the Hittites, while another wall represents Rameses
III holding a group of prisoners by the hair and raising a club as
if to strike. Close by, the god Ammon is delivering to him chained
representatives of different vanquished nations, the faces being so true
to life that the Israelities brought from Palestine can be easily distinguished
from the Ethiopians and Nubians of the south. One of the
heads seen often in the drawings resembles "the yellow kid," and the
donkeys are exactly like those seen to-day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>Luxor and Karnak are on the east bank of the Nile, but Thebes required
both sides of the river for her great population, and the west
bank is also rich in evidences of ancient civilization. The Rameseum
is here and would attract more attention if it were not overshadowed
by larger temples; here also are the "Colossi of Memmon," one of them
known to literature as the singing statue. This is described by Strabo
and Juvenal and bears many inscriptions in Latin and Greek made
by those who visited it under the Roman rule. Hadrian looked upon
it 150 <small>A. D.</small>, and a poetess of his day declares that the statue greeted
the emperor. It is supposed that the sound which for many years
issued from the head of the statue just after sunrise was caused by
the change in temperature, the granite having been cracked; at any
rate, the sound ceased when the statue was repaired. It now sits
silent, and with its companion gazes upon the barley field that reaches
out in every direction from their feet.</p>

<p>But more interesting than the Rameseum or the Colossi are the
tombs of the kings, some forty-two of which have already been discovered.
At this point the west side of the valley of the Nile is walled
in by a range of limestone hills, one of which bears a striking resemblance
to a pyramid. (Could it have suggested the idea of a pyramid
for a tomb?) Leaving the valley of the Nile about two miles north
of this pyramidal hill, there is a small dry valley which wends its way
back through the hills and terminates at the foot of steep walls just west
of the hill mentioned. Here are the tombs, hewn in the solid rock,
the most elaborate of which is the tomb of Sethos, or Seti, the father
of Rameses II. This tomb burrows into the hill to the depth of three
hundred and thirty feet, a flight of steps leading down through different
levels and different chambers to the final vault. The walls are
covered with figures in colors representing the king in the act of making
offerings to the various gods. There are also drawings illustrating
scenes in this world and life as it is supposed to be in the next world.
Some of these pictures portray a hell where the wicked are punished
with fire, and there are also drawings which have been interpreted to
represent the resurrection and judgment.</p>

<p>Not far away is the tomb of "the Pharaoh of the Exodus" which
contains a granite image of the king, and close by this tomb is another
in which the mummied form of a Pharaoh still reposes. Grave robbing,
however, was so popular an amusement in those days that the
bodies of nearly all the kings had been removed for safety to a secret
vault, which was so carefully concealed that they were not found until
the nineteenth century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>At Memphis, which is only about eighteen miles from Cairo, there
are tombs of less importance, colossal statues of Rameses II and the sarcophagi
of the sacred bulls. In one of the tombs or Mastabas, as tombs
of this style are called, are some of the drawings that have been most
widely reproduced. In one place a boy is fattening geese by the
stuffing process; in another, cranes are being fed; here, rams are treading
in the seed, and the cattle, horned and hornless, are being driven
through a river. Agriculture, ship-building, carpentering and other
industries are minutely pictured. While the human figures are stiff
and angular, the birds and beasts are so exactly like what we see to-day
that one could easily believe them to have been drawn by a modern
artist.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="pyramid" id="pyramid"></a>
<img src="images/ill147.jpg" width="450" height="295" alt="pyramid" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE PYRAMID AND THE SPHINX.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The sarcophagi of the sacred bulls, twenty-four in number, are hollowed
out from single pieces of granite and are covered with immense
slabs of the same kind of stone. Each is large enough to contain
a good sized animal, and some of them are covered with hieroglyphics
giving the pedigrees of the blue-blooded occupants. These caskets of
the royal line rest in subterranean vaults hewn out of rock and connected
by spacious halls.</p>

<p>Still nearer to Cairo, only six miles away, in fact, are the great pyramids
of Gizeh&mdash;Cheops and Khephren. These have been described<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
so often that any elaborate comment upon them might weary the
reader. We climbed to the summit of the largest, and by doing so
not only gained an idea of the immensity of this three million cubic
feet of stone, but obtained an excellent view of the green valley on the
one side and the yellow plain of shifting sand upon the other, for
these pyramids stand upon the dividing line between Egypt's far
famed fertile lands and one of the most barren of earth's deserts. We
also followed the narrow passage which leads to the center of the
pyramid and peered into the empty granite sarcophagus which, for
more than four thousand years, kept the body of the builder concealed
from the sight of man, and when we came out, half crawling
and half climbing, each assisted by two Arabs, our muscles as well
as our memories testified that we had seen all of this stupendous pile.</p>

<p>At the foot of these two pyramids stands the silent Sphinx, and near
it a granite temple almost as old. The Sphinx itself is a little disappointing
because photographs often show it in the foreground and
the pyramids behind it, and it thus appears relatively larger than it
really is. It represents the body of an animal with a human head
and is cut from a huge stone that juts out into the valley. It was a
grand conception of the brain of one long ago forgotten and is the
oldest product of the chisel of man. It has outlived unnumbered
generations and seems to mock at time. Its position by the pyramids
is a fitting one, and looking upon it and them one is awed by
the sense of their antiquity and recognizes the appropriateness of the
lines of the lecturer, Stoddard:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>

<h3>MODERN EGYPT.</h3>


<p>The first article on Egypt might have been begun with an account
of our stay in quarantine, but as this precaution against the spread of
Asiatic disease is of modern origin, I thought it best to speak of it in
this article. The P. and O. steamer, Persia, which brought us from
Bombay to Egypt, was suspected of having four cases of plague on
board. One man having died and been buried at sea just before we
reached Suez, and three more being ill, the international health board
insisted on taking charge of the ten passengers bound for Egypt. We
were taken on board a barge and towed a couple of miles up the Suez
canal to the quarantine station, which we reached about midnight.
Besides the four in our family, there were three Americans from Ohio,
two English merchants from Egypt and an English lady engaged in
missionary work in Palestine. We were comfortably housed in one-story
brick buildings and were informed that we would have to remain
there five days, unless further investigation removed the suspicion of
the plague. While the members of the company proved to be very
congenial, we were all anxious to have the stay shortened as much
as possible on account of its interference with our plans. At the end
of two days we were notified that a bubonic germ had been discovered
and that we must stay the full time. The quarantine station is situated
on the bank of the canal and is surrounded on three sides by
as barren a desert as can be found. The buildings are enclosed by a
double fence, and the only exit is to the wharf through a lane. We
were permitted to go to the wharf, and, under the escort of a guard,
were allowed to gather shells on the bank of the canal. Thus occupied,
when not reading or writing, the days passed much more pleasantly
than we had expected, and we were almost sorry when the time came
for us to separate. One day our quarters were visited by a sirocco, and
from the dust and sand that filled the air until the sun was darkened,
we were able to gain some idea of desert life.</p>

<p>The canal itself is a little disappointing. It is simply a huge ditch,
and with an expanse of sand on either bank, seems narrower than it
is. The sides are not walled as a rule, and the depth&mdash;thirty feet&mdash;does
not reveal itself. Several dredges are constantly at work removing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
the sand which drifts in with the wind or is washed in by the tide.
The canal is said to follow the route laid out more than three thousand
years ago by Rameses II. About thirty-five hundred ships pass
through the canal each year, an average of nearly ten a day. Somewhat
more than that passed during our stay, some of the ships being
loaded with Russian soldiers from Japan and others crowded with
pilgrims returning from Mecca.</p>

</div>

<p>On the afternoon of the fifth day the head physician came out and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
released us and at the same time conveyed to us the cheering, but
somewhat belated, information that the three men taken from the
ship did not have the plague; we had, however, been so courteously
treated that we did not complain of the board bills or quarantine fees,
even though the detention proved to be unnecessary. The spread of
the plague through Europe would be such a calamity that we realize
it is better to err on the side of over-caution. At any rate, we have
added to our experience and are carrying the yellow flag (the quarantine
signal) home as a trophy.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE OSTRICH FARM NEAR CAIRO.</p></div>
</div>

<p>A few hours' ride brought us to Cairo, the metropolis and capital
of Egypt. It is not an ancient city, as they count time in Egypt,
having been founded about a thousand years ago, but it has in the
business portion the appearance of a European city and contains a
population of more than half a million. Of its inhabitants thirty-five
thousand are European, the Greeks leading with about ten thousand,
and the Italians, French, English, Austrians and Germans following
in the order named. The British would outnumber the French if the
garrison were included, but the city reminds one much more of France
than of England. Many of the buildings recall the streets of Paris,
and the sidewalks adjacent to restaurants and saloons are filled with
tables and chairs, as in continental Europe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>Cairo is a city of mosques and minarets, as one quickly discovers
when he takes a bird's eye view of the city from the citadel which
stands upon an eminence in the suburbs. While the main streets
are suggestive of Europe, the native quarters and bazaars are distinctly
Oriental, many of the streets being too narrow for a carriage.
The shops are for the most part little open booths, and each line of
business has its particular section. On one street silver and gold
smiths monopolize the space; another street is gay with red shoes;
in another the red fez, the universal hat, is conspicuous; and still another
is given over to vegetables. Some of the larger stores handle
Persian rugs, silks, brass ware, inlaid work and patchwork, reproducing
the drawings found on tombs and temples. The bazaars also
abound in interesting reminders of the land of the mummy, the
pyramid and the sphinx.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">EGYPTIAN LADIES.</p></div>
</div>

<p>We had not been in Cairo long before we visited the banks of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
Nile, that wonderful river without whose fructifying waters there
would have been no Egypt. It is one of the most remarkable&mdash;in some
respects the most remarkable&mdash;of all the rivers of the earth. No wonder
the ancient Egyptians included a Nile god among their deities,
for next to the sun, to which they raised their obelisks, nothing was
so necessary to their existence as this almost magic stream. The Nile
renders fertile two narrow strips, one on either bank, four thousand
miles long, and but a few miles wide. For thirteen hundred miles
it floats through a desert and receives but a single tributary in that
distance, and yet, after supplying irrigation for the crops of some ten
millions of people, it pours into the ocean a scarcely diminished
stream. The annual rise of the river not only supplies water but it
renews the land by deposits of alluvial soil. Someone has described
the Nile valley as appearing, if seen from above, like a strip of green
carpet on a floor of gold, so yellow are the sands that hem it in. No
one who has not visited an arid country and noted the influence of
water upon the thirsty soil can imagine how distinctly the line is
drawn between the verdant field and the barren desert that adjoins it.
Where the waters of the Nile can be brought upon the land, a farm will
rent for $30 per acre, while a few feet away the land can not be given
away. Lord Cromer, in a recent report, gives the income and expenditure
of a number of the fellaheen, or farmers. The statements
show that a hundred dollars' worth of cotton is sometimes produced
from a single acre, or about thirty dollars' worth of corn. The average
income, taking all crops together, often runs as high as $50 per acre.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>An increasing quantity of land is being brought under the canals,
but irrigation from wells is still the main reliance of a large proportion
of the people. Water can be found at the level of the water in
the river, and the landscape is dotted over with old-fashioned well
sweeps and with water wheels, where blindfolded camels or oxen tread
their patient round. The land produces so abundantly and there is
such a variety of garden and farm products that one recalls that passage
in the Bible in which the children of Israel are described as longing
for "the flesh pots of Egypt." Coming from India to Egypt we
could not but notice the difference in the appearance of the people.
In the former country they looked so emaciated and hungry; in the
latter they are strong and robust and seemingly well fed. In the
markets, too, the food is heaped up in big baskets, while in India it
is exposed for sale in tiny piles that speak only too plainly of the
poverty of the people.</p>

<p>For ages upon ages the fellaheen have drawn from the inexhaustible
storehouse of the Nile. Cheops, Khephren and their successors built
pyramids, and the fellah fed the builders; Thutmosis and Sethos and
their descendants constructed tombs and temples, and the fellah supported
the laborers; the Rameses added gigantic statues to the stupendous
works of their ancestors and the fellah still furnished food;
the Persians overran the country and still the hand of the fellah supplied
the necessaries of life; then came Alexander the Great and the
Ptolemies, Cæsar, Antony and Cleopatra, and the fellah plowed on;
after the Roman came the Arab, and after the Arab the Turk, followed
by Napoleon and later by the Briton, but through all this change
of dynasties the fellah kept "the noiseless tenor of his way," and as a
middle man, handed over the bounties of the Nile valley to the rulers
and their armies&mdash;and he is doing so to-day. Of the eleven hundred
thousand land owners, nearly nine hundred and fifty thousand hold
less than five acres each, and almost half of the total acreage is owned
by twelve thousand three hundred persons. More than one-tenth of
the tillable land is owned by sixteen hundred Europeans.</p>

<p>Very few horses are seen in the country, the beasts of burden being
the ox (there are a few water buffaloes also), the donkey and the
camel. The ox resembles the American rather than the Indian ox, in
that it has no hump on its shoulders and the drawings on some of the
walls represent cattle with horns as large as those formerly worn by
the Texas steer. The donkey&mdash;poor, patient creature&mdash;has not changed
materially in the last four thousand years. The pictures drawn of
him by the ancient Egyptians show him just as he is now. Then, as
now, a large part of his nourishment went to the development of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
vocal organs and left the rest of his body woefully small for the large
burdens which he was called upon to carry. If his disposition was as
gloomy in the days of the Pharaohs as it is at present, he probably
annoyed them when he lifted up his voice and wept, as he now annoys
the tourist.</p>

<p>The camel, however, if the test is special fitness for the country,
is the king of beasts. He pulls the plow, turns the water wheel, draws
the wagon, carries burdens, and for long distance travel outstrips the
horse. Equipped with emergency water tanks, he can go for several
days without drinking, and for this reason is of inestimable value on
desert journeys. He kneels to receive his load, though sometimes
with pathetic groans, and is as docile as the horse. He has sometimes
been styled "the ship of the desert" and seems to have been fashioned
for this peculiar region. His large, padded feet do not add to his
beauty, but they enable him to cross sandy plains into which a horse's
hoof would sink.</p>

<p>The Bible says that the plague of flies brought upon Egypt, when
Moses was endeavoring to secure the release of the Israelites, was removed
when Pharaoh promised to let the people go, but one is inclined
to think that they afterwards returned when Pharaoh again hardened
his heart, for nowhere have we found flies like those of Egypt. They
bite with unusual vigor and are very persistent in their attentions. At
first we thought it strange that people should carry horse-hair brushes
as a protection against the flies, but we were soon driven to follow
their example. These flies seem to be especially attracted to the eyes
of children. As these flies, like those in other countries, carry disease,
it is not strange that sore eyes should be especially prevalent here.
Blindness seems to be more common than elsewhere, and a very considerable
percentage of the people have lost one eye. So widespread
is this affliction that Sir Ernest Cassel has established a fund of forty
thousand pounds, the interest on which is to be devoted to the treatment
of diseases of the eye. Already the fruits of this beneficence are
being enjoyed by the poor. The Mohammedan women in Egypt wear
veils&mdash;a custom which is but slowly giving way to western ideas. If
the eyes of the children were protected with half as much care as the
faces of the women, what benefits would result!</p>

<p>The government of Egypt defies definition. Nominally the Khedive
is the supreme authority, aided by a native legislative council and assembly
(their business is to advise, however, rather than to legislate),
but back of the Khedive is Lord Cromer, the agent and consul-general
of England, whose power is undefined and almost unlimited. England's
authority in Egypt rests upon the articles of capitulation signed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
after the bombardment of Alexandria in 1882. In these articles it
was announced that England's occupancy would be of brief duration,
but in 1904 she secured from France, Germany, Austria-Hungary and
Italy consent to postpone the fixing of a date for her withdrawal, she at
the same time announcing that it was not her intention to interfere
with the political situation in Egypt. England's reasons for remaining
in Egypt are very clearly stated by Lord Milner in his book entitled
"England in Egypt." He says: "On the one hand, our commercial
interests in Egypt are so great and growing that her prosperity, which
would be immediately wrecked by misgovernment, is a matter of concern
to us. Secondly, and chiefly, the geographical position of Egypt
compels attention to her political condition. We have nothing to
gain by owning the country ourselves, but we should have a great
deal to fear from its falling into the possession of another power."</p>

<p>England's interests in
Egypt are numerous. She
takes most of the exports
of Egypt and sells more
than any other country to
Egypt. In the last report
of Lord Cromer it is shown
that Great Britain has the
benefit of considerably
more than half of the contracts
(above five thousand
dollars) entered into
by the Egyptian railways
for supplies. Then, England's
citizens own land in
Egypt, and they are also
interested in the Egyptian
debt, which, by the way,
amounts to about five hundred
million dollars or, approximately,
one hundred
dollars per acre of the tillable
land.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">KHEDIVE OF EGYPT.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The irrigation schemes
now developing will require the expenditure of large sums on contract
and these will give opportunities for English capital.</p>

<p>The second reason given by Lord Milner is emphasized by him,
and is probably the paramount one, viz., that she can not afford to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
have the valley of the Nile held by a rival power. Her interests in
the Soudan and in India lead her to guard the Suez canal with jealous
care. Lord Milner suggests as a reason why England should remain
in Egypt that her withdrawal might be followed by such an abuse of
government as to lead to bankruptcy and French intervention. The
old argument "if we don't do it somebody else will" is presented as
the strongest support of British interference.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">REUNION ON THE DESERT.</p></div>
</div>

<p>English influence, however, has been less harmful in Egypt than
in India, and this is probably due, in the main, to two causes: First,
her influence is exerted through a native government whose authority
she acknowledges; and second, because the interests, which other nations
have in Egypt, make them oppose any encroachments on the
part of England, while in India she has a free hand. As an illustration
I might cite the fact that she compels the Indian to support
the Indian army, while she pays the ordinary expenses of the three
thousand British soldiers in Egypt and only asks Egypt to pay for the
extraordinary expenses. It is no reflection upon England to say that
she is better for being watched. We believe that in regard to our own
public men, and it is simply a recognition of the frailty of human
nature. Lord Cromer has been in Egypt for twenty-six years, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
his reports indicate a desire to advance the welfare of the people of
Egypt. He has doubtless been helpful to the Khedive. He has
insisted upon honesty in the public service and has been a friend of
education. While the national debt contains a large amount of usurious
interest and is, therefore, much heavier than it ought to be, it has
been funded at a lower rate of interest and is being gradually paid
off. The debts that are being incurred for the extension of irrigation
will be more than redeemed by the sale of the land reclaimed, and
the country will then have the benefit, not only of the reclaimed
land but of the increased value of lands indirectly benefited. Although
the salt tax (contrary to Lord Cromer's advice) is still over
two hundred per cent, the per capita rate of taxation has been reduced;
agricultural and postal banks have been established, and the government
railway, telegraph and telephone systems have been extended.
In his 1903 report, Lord Cromer presents an argument in favor of
government roads as against roads owned privately.</p>

<p>The great danger that Egypt has to fear is the disinheritance of
the fellaheen and the alien ownership of the land. Unless great care is
taken Egypt will drift into the condition of Ireland and India, and be
drained of her resources by foreign landlords. It is very difficult
for a foreign representative to arbitrate impartially between his own
people at home and the natives among whom he temporarily resides,
and Lord Cromer will deserve great credit if he is able to protect the
Egyptians from exploitation. However well meaning the English
advisers are now, or hereafter may be, Egypt's safety must lie in the
development of her own people. The legislative council understands
this and insists upon the extension of the school system. It is wise in
so doing, for every educated man or woman adds to the moral force
that restrains and directs the government. An increase in the number
of the educated not only tends to the preservation of law and order,
but furnishes a larger number fit to be officials and thus lessens the
excuse for the employment of foreigners. There has been, among reformers,
some discussion of a constitution, but as that would curtail the
powers of the Khedive as well as define the authority of England, it
would probably be opposed at present by the Moslem leaders.</p>

<p>I can not conclude without reference to the pioneer work done in
the field of education by the United Presbyterians. They have several
churches and a number of very successful schools and must be credited
with having contributed largely to the progress which Egypt has
made and is making.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>

<h3>AMONG THE LEBANONS.</h3>


<p>Before writing of the Holy Land, I shall devote an article to the
week which we spent among the Lebanons. While the trip from Beyrout
to Baalbek and Damascus is included in the advertisement of
Palestine tours, the places visited are not so intimately connected with
Bible history as those of Judea and Galilee.</p>

<p>Beyrout, the seaport for this section of Syria, has the best harbor
to be found on the east coast of the Mediterranean, and the city is
naturally a place of considerable size and importance. The population
is estimated at about one hundred and fifty thousand, and the
residence portion covers the foothills of the Lebanon range. The
principal industry is the production of raw silk, the mulberry groves
extending as far as the eye can reach.</p>

<p>The road from Beyrout to Baalbek climbs over the Lebanon range,
reaching in one place an altitude of about six thousand feet. The
view is one of rare beauty&mdash;the winding shore of the Mediterranean,
the terraced mountain sides and the snow clad peaks combining to form
an impressive picture. The far-famed cedars of Lebanon, some of
them sixteen feet in diameter, still crown the higher summits, but
few of them are visible from the train. A well built carriage road follows
the same general course as the railroad, but the latter now monopolizes
the traffic. The main line of the railroad runs to Damascus,
but in the Beka, as the valley of the Leontes is called at this point,
a branch has been built to Baalbek, where a wonderful temple once
stood.</p>

<p>The city of Baalbek was founded so long ago that history does not
record its beginning. Arab tradition peoples this district with the
earliest of the Bible characters. The tower of Babel has been located
at Baalbek by one tradition, while another has Cain building a fortress
there as a refuge. It is certain that the city ranks among the oldest
known to history, the location being probably determined by the presence
of a very large spring whose waters would supply a great population.
The name of the city (but a few thousand inhabitants are to
be found there now) indicates that it was the center of Baal, or sun,
worship. It is believed by those who have made research that an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
ancient temple, built by the Egyptians or Ph&oelig;nicians, occupied the
ground now covered by the ruins of a later temple built by the
Romans. It is this latter temple which has drawn tourists from all
over the world. It was begun during the first century of the Christian
era, and the work upon it continued for more than two hundred
years. It was dedicated to Jupiter and the Sun, the worship of these
two deities being combined. The Romans even adopted the Greek
name, Heliopolis, for the city, but the Arabic designation, Baalbek,
has survived.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="baalbek" id="baalbek"></a>
<img src="images/ill155.jpg" width="450" height="423" alt="baalbek" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">TEMPLE AT BAALBEK</p></div>
</div>

<p>This great temple was laid out upon an immense scale. First a hill
was built, filled with subterranean chambers, and upon the massive
walls which separated these chambers the superstructure was reared.
The temple was approached by a staircase one hundred and fifty feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
wide and entered through a hexagonal court two hundred feet in
diameter. Next came the great court, nearly four hundred feet square,
with an altar in the center. Both of these courts were open, but had
broad colonnades around the sides supported by granite pillars brought
from the upper Nile. These colonnades were ornamented with carvings
and contained two rows of niches, three hundred and thirty altogether,
formerly occupied by images. Our guide, Mr. Alouf, whose
pamphlet on Baalbek gives the results of his fifteen years' study of
the ruins, insists that the great court was really a pantheon and contained
all of the gods at that time worshiped by the conquerors and
by the native population.</p>

<p>The temple of Jupiter must have been a most impressive building.
It stood twenty-six feet above the courts and therefore about fifty feet
above the natural level of the ground around. It measured three hundred
and ten feet in length and one hundred and sixty in breadth.
Its outer wall supported fifty-four columns of Corinthian style, each
column being seventy feet in height, seven feet in diameter and composed
of three pieces. Six of these columns are still standing, having
survived three earthquakes and one mountain torrent. The six columns
with the capitals and cornice give some idea of the magnificence
of the temple before its decay. The stone used is taken from a limestone
quarry near the city, and the carving is excellent. Enormous
masses of stone lie scattered over the ground&mdash;parts of pillars, pieces of
cornice, and sections of the pediment. How these huge blocks were
ever lifted into place is still a matter of conjecture. No mortar was
used, and yet in some places the joints are so nicely fitted and the
stone so accurately cut that a knife blade can not be inserted after a
lapse of nearly twenty centuries.</p>

<p>Stupendous as is the plan of this wonderful temple and elaborate as
is its ornamentation, the most remarkable feature is the size of the
stones employed. The guide first shows a number of blocks about
thirty-three feet long, fourteen feet high and ten feet thick. After one's
wonder has had sufficient time to express itself, three blocks are pointed
out which measure sixty-four feet in length, fourteen feet in height and
twelve feet in thickness. The estimated weight of one of these stones is
nearly one thousand tons, and it is calculated that it would require ten
thousand horse power to lift it. At the quarry about three-quarters of a
mile away a companion block, seventy-two feet long and about fifteen
feet in height and thickness is to be seen, chiseled from the stone about
it, but not entirely separated from the stratum beneath it. This was
probably intended for the sustaining wall around the temple. Whether
it remained at the quarry because the work was interrupted, or because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
the builders despaired of being able to move it, is a secret which the
living are not able to reveal. After the decline of paganism the Christians
built a church in the great court, using the stones and pillars for
the walls. Then came the Mohammedans and turned the courts and
temple into a fortress, making use of the walls of the church.</p>

</div>

<p>A little way distant from the great temple is a smaller temple dedicated
to Bacchus, which would of itself be sufficient to distinguish a city,
but for its more famous rival. This temple is about two hundred and
twenty-five feet long by one hundred and ten feet wide, and a row of
fifty columns, of which fourteen are fluted, surround it. These columns
are sixty feet in height and about six feet in diameter. While smaller
in its dimensions this temple is even more elaborately carved than the
larger one. Some of the clusters of grapes are less than two inches in
length but exquisitely wrought. This temple is in a much better state
of preservation than the great temple and is therefore in some respects
even more interesting.</p>

<p>Emperor William of Germany visited Baalbek in 1898 and was so
impressed by the ruins that he obtained permission from the sultan to
clear away the debris, and the traveling world is under obligations to
him for having made it possible to inspect the foundations and the
ground plan. In this connection it may be added that Emperor William
seems to take a deep interest in this part of Asia. He visited Jerusalem
to lay the corner stone of the German church; he sent to Damascus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
a beautiful bronze wreath to adorn the tomb of the great Mohammedan
general, Saladin, and he has encouraged the establishment of
German colonies in Palestine. There are German settlements of considerable
size at Jerusalem, Joppa, and Haifa. At four places we found
German hotels, and it is needless to say that they are kept with the
excellence characteristic of the race.</p>

<p>The friendship which the emperor has shown for the sultan seems to
be reciprocated, for roads were built, harbors improved and many other
things done in honor of his visit. We have heard all sorts of rumors as
to the kaiser's intentions, but the only thing that seems certain is that
German influence in this part of Asia is increasing.</p>

<p>While Baalbek contains the largest and most famous ruins, it is not
the only place that attracts the archæologist. There are hundreds of
sites of ancient cities which abundantly repay the excavator. Specimens
of Greek and Roman art have been found on both sides of the
Jordan as well as along the Mediterranean coast. The tombs also have
yielded up their treasures and the museums of the world have been supplied
with tear bottles, perfumery jars, vases, bowls, scarabs, ancient
coins, etc.</p>

<p>The Ph&oelig;nicians are credited with having invented the making of
glass in the days when Tyre and Sidon were their chief cities. It is said
that the art owes its discovery to the use of saltpeter in the place of
stones by some sailors who landed at the mouth of the river Belos, near
Akka. Finding no stones upon which to put their kettles, they used
blocks of saltpeter and were surprised to find that the fire had fused the
sand and saltpeter into a transparent substance. The industry was inaugurated
at Tyre and Sidon, and for some time the Ph&oelig;nicians supplied
the world with glass. The bottles and vases found from time to
time in the tombs of Syria and Egypt are more beautiful than when
they left the hand of the manufacturer; the outer surface has decayed,
and beneath are revealed all the colors of the rainbow. It was the custom
to fill the tear bottles with tears of the mourners and to bury them with
the dead.</p>

<p>The scarab, which is found so often in the ancient tombs in Syria
and in Egypt, is the old fashioned tumble-bug or dung beetle with
which every boy, or at least every country or village boy, is familiar. I
little thought, when I used to see the tumble-bug rolling his little globe
of manure along the dusty road, that he was considered a sacred insect
several thousand years ago or that he was ever used as a symbol of the
Creator; and yet his likeness adorns temples and tombs while his image,
cut in stone and bearing the seal of rulers, has been found by the
thousands. Often the heart of a dead person was removed and a scarab<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
inserted in its place. The scarab, rolling its ball, typified to the ancient
an unseen power guiding the sun while the bursting of the young bug
from its egg in the ball symbolized the resurrection&mdash;to what classical
uses this commonplace little insect was put!</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">CEDARS OF LEBANON</p></div>
</div>

<p>Among those who have been instrumental in bringing the hidden
treasures of Syria to the attention of the world, Mr. Azeez Khayat, a
native of Tyre, but now an American citizen, deserves special mention.
Many American museums are indebted to him for their collections.</p>

<p>Speaking of Tyre and Sidon reminds me that in the study of Syria
and Palestine, I ran across an early instance of monopoly. Josephus
accuses John of Gischala of monopolizing the oil business on the
Mediterranean coast. It was early in the Christian era that the aforesaid
John, according to Josephus, convinced the Jews who dwelt in Syria<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
that they were obliged to use oil made by others, and the historian adds:
"So he (John) bought four amphoræ with such Syrian money as was
of the value of four Attic drachmæ and sold every half amphor at the
same price; and as Galilee was very fruitful in oil and was peculiarly
so at this time, by sending away great quantities and having the sole
privilege so to do, he gathered an immense sum of money together."</p>

<p>This is interesting and instructive. It shows, first, that monopoly is an
ancient evil and, second, that the monopolist in his inclination to take
advantage of the consumer by raising the price was much the same then
as now&mdash;but I have been afraid, ever since I read of John of Gischala,
that some American named John might try to imitate him and establish
a monopoly in our country&mdash;possibly in oil.</p>

<p>But on to Damascus&mdash;and we reached it all too soon, for the ride
across the Anti-Lebanon range is also picturesque. The route down the
east side of the mountain follows the valley of the Abana, a splendid
stream, worthy of the compliment paid it by Naaman. It leaps from the
mountain side a full grown river and plunges down into the plain only
to be lost in the sands, but not until it has brought verdure to many
square miles that would otherwise be barren. It is easy to understand
why Damascus is among the oldest, if not actually the oldest, of all the
cities still standing. It occupies the one green spot in all that section
and is the outpost of the Mediterranean coast. The Arabian desert
stretches to the east and southeast for hundreds of miles, and the caravans
from Persia and Arabia pass through Damascus on their way to
Egypt even now, as they did when Babylon and Ninevah were young;
it is also on the road between the great East and Tyre and Sidon.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">BEYROUTH&mdash;SYRIA</p></div>
</div>

<p>Damascus is an Oriental city and is still innocent of the ways of the
western world. Its bazaars give one a glimpse of life as it was before
Europe and America were known to history. The government is erecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
public buildings according to modern plans; but the covered streets,
lined with little booths, the homes of the people, the dress, the customs
and the habits are the same that they were when Saul of Tarsus wandered
down the street "called Straight" in search of the one who was to
restore his sight. (This street though straight as compared with the
other streets, is hardly deserving of the name which it still bears.)</p>

<p>As in Cairo, the different trades have different sections. The dealers
in sugar occupy one quarter; the silversmiths, the candy manufacturers,
the blacksmiths, the carpenters&mdash;each class has its cluster of shops. The
Arabian horse being the pride of the Bedouin, we were not surprised to
find much attention paid to the manufacture of saddles, saddle bags,
bridles and trappings, only they were for the most part made of wool
and cotton rather than of leather. Bright colors, tassels, fringes, shells
and ostrich feathers are employed in the ornamentation of the horse,
the donkey and the camel.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="tail" id="tail"></a>
<img src="images/ill159.jpg" width="450" height="281" alt="tail" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE BIG TAIL SHEEP.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The candies of Damascus are good and very cheap, and nuts of all
kinds are to be found in abundance, an excellent variety of walnut
being grown within the city limits. Naturally this city is a market for
Persian rugs and large stocks are kept on hand. While the people make
everything which enters into the daily life of the country, they are
especially skilled in brass, damascene ware and the inlaying of wood
with mother-of-pearl.</p>

<p>Damascus is not especially noted for places of historical interest. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
tourist is shown the house of Ananias and the window through which
Paul was let down from the wall, but it is doubtful whether the identity
of these places has been really established. A house, known as the house
of Naaman the Leper, is now very appropriately used for a leper's home.
There is no uncertainty about the river Abana, and another river near
Damascus known as Pharpar. An ancient wall surrounds the city, and
one of the largest mosques in the world occupies ground first dedicated
to a heathen temple and afterward to the church of St. John the Baptist,
erected by Arcadius, the son of Theodosius.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="dogs" id="dogs"></a>
<img src="images/ill160.jpg" width="450" height="407" alt="dogs" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">DAMASCUS DOGS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The big-tailed sheep described by Herodotus is to be found on the
streets of Damascus. It is a peculiar breed, and the tail, which is considered
a great delicacy, is often so heavy as to seem a burden to the
sheep. It is broad, covered with wool, and sometimes ends in a curl.
We also saw here the long-eared goats, as curious looking in their way as
the sheep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>And what shall we say of the Damascus dog? He is to be found everywhere
and has no owner. We counted eighteen in one group and two
hundred and thirty-eight in one forenoon's ride. They live on charity
and fight whenever an opportunity offers. It seems to be against the law
of the sultan to kill dogs, as one learns to his regret after he has heard
them barking at all hours of the night. It is superfluous to add that the
flea is as common as the dog, and as indifferent also to the peace of the
stranger.</p>

<p>A new railroad which is now building from Damascus to the south
will soon make it possible to go to Galilee in a few hours, but now it is
more convenient to return to Beyrout and go to Haifa by boat. This we
did, and having a couple of days at Beyrout we learned something of
the religious work done there.</p>

<p>In the division of territory the Presbyterians of America were, in
1870, assigned the country around Beyrout. The district is divided into
the Beyrout, Lebanon, Sidon and Tripoli stations, and at all of these
stations schools, as well as churches, are being established. So successful
has the work been that the native communities now contribute half a
dollar for every dollar sent from America. There is also an American
press at Beyrout which publishes the Bible in Arabic, some eighty thousand
copies being issued last year in addition to religious tracts of various
kinds. One of the leaders in the missionary movement, Rev. H. H.
Jessup, has completed his fiftieth year of service among the Syrians.</p>

<p>The Syrian Protestant college is also located in Beyrout; it occupies a
beautiful site overlooking the sea and is in sight of the highest peak of
the Lebanons. While Christian in management, this college is not denominational
but is under the control of an American board representing
a number of churches. Between six and seven hundred young men
are in attendance, and its graduates are scattered throughout the world.
Within its halls are to be found Protestants, Catholics (both Greek and
Roman), Armenians, Jews and Mohammedans, and its influences in
these parts can scarcely be overestimated.</p>

<p>The present president of the college, Dr. Howard S. Bliss, is the worthy
son of the college's first president, Dr. Daniel Bliss, whose religious
and educational work in this territory covers more than half a century.
The elder Bliss, now past eighty-three, and his wife are enjoying an
enviable experience. Their active labors over, with minds still alert and
with hearts still young, they are spending the evening of their lives near
the scenes of their labors and among the children and grandchildren
who have blessed their home. Their rest has been earned, and the peace
of their latter years is a merited reward. Surely they illustrate the blessedness
of lives consecrated to a high purpose and rich in noble service.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>

<h3>THE CHRISTIAN'S MECCA.</h3>


<p>We were agreeably surprised in Jerusalem and Judea, but disappointed
to learn how few Protestant Christians visited this city which
may without impropriety be styled the Christian's Mecca. Possibly
the wretched harbor at Joppa&mdash;if harbor it can be called&mdash;may
frighten some away, for when the weather is bad passengers are often
carried by, and yet it does seem that there should be more than
four thousand a year from the rich and numerous churches of Europe
and America. More than ninety thousand pilgrims visit the Mohammedan
Mecca each year, although the Mohammedans are poor and the
journey is difficult. Port Said is only a hundred and thirty-five miles
from Joppa and Alexandria less than three hundred miles, and more
than ninety-nine thousand persons disembarked at these ports last year.
Making a liberal allowance for Egyptians returning from Europe,
for immigrants from Europe to Egypt, and for invalids visiting Cairo
in search of health, it is still true that many times as many go to the
Nile as travel to Jerusalem, and of the less than four thousand
tourists who visit the Holy City less than one thousand continue
their journey to Nazareth and the Sea of Galilee. The number
which I mention does not include the Greek Catholics or the Roman
Catholics, but is an outside estimate of the number of Protestant
Christians. The railroads which are building and the carriage roads
in process of construction will make travel easier and may increase
the number in the future, but it is difficult to explain or to understand
why so many have come near to, and yet passed by, without
seeing the places made familiar to the Christian world by the books
of the Old and the New Testament.</p>

<p>We landed at Joppa when the weather was fair, but were detained
a half day that they might "de-ratify the ship," as the Turkish authorities
describe rat-killing upon the ship&mdash;a custom inaugurated after
the rat had been convicted of carrying bubonic plague. Joppa is on
the edge of the Plain of Sharon and, as an abundance of water can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
be secured at a reasonable depth, the city is a garden. Orange trees
thrive there and the fruit is excellent. Two places of interest are shown,
the home of Tabitha and the house of Simon the tanner, the latter
immortalized by the vision which taught Peter the universality of
Christ's mission.</p>

<p>The railroad to Jerusalem crosses the valley of Sharon which, at
this season of the year, is exceedingly attractive. The crops are growing,
the fellaheen are at work in the fields and everywhere the wild flowers
bloom. The rose of Sharon had many rivals, if the plain looked in
olden times as it does now. The principal station on the plain is Ramleh,
through which conquering armies marched for ages. From time
immemorial Palestine has been a prize of war. When it was not itself
the object of conquest, its occupation was necessary to the acquiring
or holding of other territory. The Persians, the Egyptians, the Parthians,
the Scythians, the Greeks, the Romans and the Turks have all
overrun this country&mdash;not to speak of the numerous wars of the
Israelites and the expeditions of the Crusaders. From Alexander the
Great and Cæsar to Napoleon, no world-conquering general overlooked
Palestine&mdash;and yet, out of Palestine came the Prince of Peace.</p>

<p>South of Sharon lies the plain of Philistia, a narrow strip of land between
the hills of Judea and the sea, a small region, and yet it supported
a people who warred for centuries with the Children of Israel. It was at
Gaza, one of the chief cities on this plain, that Samson pulled down the
pillars of the building and died with those who made sport of him.</p>

<p>Leaving the low country, the railroad begins the ascent of the Judean
hills through the Wady es Suar, and as one is carried up the tortuous
course of the narrow valley he begins to understand why Jerusalem
was considered a citadel. The hills rise to a height of about twenty-five
hundred feet and are so inaccessible that a small number dwelling
on top could easily defend themselves against a much larger force.
The narrow limits of Judea impress one, hemmed in as it is on the
west by Philistia, on the south by the desert and on the east by the
deep chasm of the Dead Sea. Its history was developed in a territory
scarcely larger than a Nebraska county.</p>

<p>As we approached the summit the vineyards appeared and the olive
groves became more numerous. Jerusalem is beautifully located. No
wonder its rebuilding and re-peopling is the dream of the devout Jews,
many of whom come from distant corners of the earth to spend their
last days within its precincts. The present walls of the city are only
a few hundred years old, but the Tower of David is believed to be
a part of the wall erected by the great Hebrew king.</p>

<p>Once within the city, one is surrounded on every hand by places that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
stir the tenderest of memories. Even the uncertainty as to the identification
of many of the sites made sacred by the life, the sufferings and
the death of Christ&mdash;even the rivalry between the various sects cannot
prevent a feeling of reverence. Here He whose name is borne by increasing
millions was condemned without cause, crowned with thorns and
at last crucified, sealing with His blood the testimony of His life.</p>

<p>Early in the fourth century Helena, the mother of Constantine, set
out to identify the spots most intimately associated with the Savior's
life. She selected the place where, as she believed, Christ was crucified
and buried, and her son erected the Church of the Holy Sepulchre
to mark the locality. For fifteen centuries her designation was accepted
as the correct one, and the Roman Catholics, the Greek Catholics and
the Armenians, who divide the space in the church between them, have
kept joint, though not always harmonious, watch over the various
altars and chapels. A few years ago the correctness of the location
of Calvary was disputed and a hill over the Grotto of Jeremiah was
fixed upon by the dissenters as the place of the crucifixion, and a tomb
near by as the sepulchre. Since that time the traveler has been shown
both places and furnished with the arguments in support of the claims
of each. It is contended that the Church of the Holy Sepulchre,
though within the present walls, stands upon land which was outside
of the original walls, while the new location is outside of the walls as
they are at present. Possibly future excavations may settle the question
by determining the exact location of the wall in the time of Christ;
but what matter? The two places are not far apart, and the whole
vicinity has been hallowed by His presence.</p>

<p>Pilate's judgment hall, the Via Dolorosa and Ecce Homo arch are
marked by the erection of a Catholic convent and school for girls
where one finds a cleanliness in striking contrast to the streets outside.
The pools of Gihon, of Siloam, of Bethesda and Hezekiah are all given
a local habitation; the place where Judas hanged himself is pointed
out, as well as the cave in which Jeremiah wrote his lamentations; the
chamber where the Last Supper was observed is also fixed upon, and the
tombs of Rachel, Absalom and of David. I do not know how much
credence should be given to the testimony adduced in behalf of these
different sites, but we are sure of the identity of a few places. Mount
Zion, upon which David built his palace, is known; Mount Akra can
be located and about Mount Moriah there can be no mistake. The
great bare rock that crowns the last named eminence is a landmark
that has not been and cannot be easily removed. It is now
covered by a mosque but was once the sacrificial stone of the Hebrews.
Solomon's temple was built on Mount Moriah, and some of its foundation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
stones and subterranean chambers can still be seen. In a street
that leads by these foundation walls is the Jews' wailing place where
for many centuries devout Hebrews, gathered from every country, have
met on each Friday afternoon to bemoan the fate of Jerusalem and to
petition for the restoration of the kingdom. One sees no more pathetic
sight in a trip around the world than this assemblage of men and
women, some gray-haired, some in middle life and many mere children,
chanting their laments and caressing the stones which the hand of
Solomon laid when he was building the temple which marked the
summit of Jewish political power.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="olives" id="olives"></a>
<img src="images/ill161.jpg" width="450" height="325" alt="olives" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">MOUNT OF OLIVES.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Bethlehem is also identified and whether or not the Church of the
Nativity, erected by the mother of Constantine, covers the spot where
Christ was born, one can look upon the hills around about the city and
recall that it was here that the message, "Peace on earth, good will to
men," came to the shepherds who kept their flocks by night.</p>

<p>In the Garden of Gethsemane, by the Brook Kedron, one can tread
the soil pressed by the Master's feet in the hours of his loneliness and
agony. The Garden is now walled in and carefully kept, and its old,
gnarled and knotted olive trees shade the pansies which grow there in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
profusion. Bethpage still stands and also Bethany, where Mary and
Martha and Lazarus lived, and, most conspicuous of all, the Mount
of Olives, the place of the Ascension. From its summit the best view
of Jerusalem is obtained; from that point also the eye can sweep the
hills of both Judea and Samaria and to the east look upon the waters
of the Dead Sea, thirty-eight hundred feet below.</p>

<p>Nowhere else can one walk amid scenes so familiar to the civilized
world as are those of Judea. Surrounded by paganism and idolatry,
a little band began here the establishment of a monotheistic religion
and notwithstanding backslidings, shortcomings and wanderings from
the faith, the spiritual side of life was never entirely forgotten; great
prophets thundered their warnings from these hills; great singers
poured forth their hymns of penitence, praise and thanksgiving; here
a wonderful literature was developed and a history written which was
stranger than fiction; and here, in the fulness of time, came One who
was commissioned to substitute the law of Love for the law that
required "an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth."</p>

<p>In the city of Jerusalem there are now some sixty thousand souls,
and a composite population it is. While about two-thirds of the people
are Jews and the remainder divided almost equally between the
Mohammedans and Christians, one can count representatives of a score
or more of nations in an hour's walk. The streets of Jerusalem are narrow
and crooked, and one is going up hill or down hill all the time. The
houses, the stores, the walls, the gates and the customs of the people
seem more Oriental than European. There are no street cars, no modern
bookstores and no newspapers, excepting one printed in Hebrew.</p>

<p>The carriage road from Jerusalem to Jericho winds around the
Mount of Olives and down the eastern side of the Judean hills, past the
Apostles' fountain and through the wilderness of Judea. This wilderness
is not the waste that we expected to find, but merely a broken
and mountainous country, too stony to be cultivated and fit only for
grazing. At this season of the year the grass is green and the ground
bright with flowers.</p>

<p>A little more than half way down the slope is a rest station called,
in honor of the parable, the Good Samaritan Inn. But for the
mounted guards who now patrol this road the traveler would even
to-day be in danger of falling among thieves.</p>

<p>A little farther on, the road leads near the edge of a wild, deep and
rugged canyon at the bottom of which plunges the Brook Cherith.
A Greek monastery has been built at the place where Elijah found
refuge during the drought.</p>

<p>Jericho is a small village and a half mile from the site of the ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
city of that name. It depends for its support upon the tourists who
visit the Jordan valley rather than upon the cultivated area.</p>

<p>The Dead Sea, forty miles long and eight miles in width, covers
the deepest portion of this most remarkable of the depressions in
the earth's surface. The rent extends from the base of Mount Hermon
to the eastern arm of the Red Sea, known as the Gulf of Akabah. For
more than one hundred miles this rent or ravine is below the level of
the sea, the surface of the Dead Sea being thirteen hundred feet lower
than the Mediterranean. As the Dead Sea is in some places thirteen
hundred feet deep, the greatest depth of the chasm is, therefore, more
than twenty-six hundred feet. The water of the Sea is bitter and contains
twenty-six per cent of salt, or about five times as much as the
ocean. As we took a bath in the Dead Sea, we can testify that one cannot
sink in its waters.</p>

</div>

<p>The Jordan is neither as large nor as clear as one would expect from
its prominence in Bible history. The banks are slippery, the waters are
muddy and the current is swift. It has much the appearance of a creek
swollen with rain. We tried its waters also, but did not venture far from
the shore. Between the Sea of Galilee and the Dead Sea the Jordan
falls about six hundred feet, or ten feet to the mile. At present but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
little use is made of this fertile valley, but, in the opinion of some who
have investigated the matter, it could, with proper irrigation and under
a just government, be made as fruitful as the valley of the Nile. As
might be expected, the heat in this deep basin is intense in the summer,
but the hills are near enough on each side to provide homes for those
who would cultivate the fields.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">A JEWISH RABBI.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Looking across the Jordan one sees the Mountains of Moab. While
the country "beyond the Jordan" plays an unimportant part in Bible
history as compared with Judea, Samaria and Galilee, still it has its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
Nebo, where the great Jewish lawgiver sleeps in an unmarked grave;
it has its Macherus, where John the Baptist was beheaded, and its
Gilead. Elijah, the Tishbite, came from beyond the Jordan, and beyond
the Jordan Elisha received his teacher's mantle; Ruth came from
the Land of Moab, and Job endured his trials in the Land of Uz.</p>

<p>Space does not permit a reference to all the places of interest or an
elaborate consideration of any of them. It is impossible to describe
in a few words what it requires several days to see. One thought often
comes to the mind as the different scenes are visited, viz., that a visit
to the Holy Land makes it easier to understand many Bible passages
and gives added significance to others. We have seen the barren fig
tree and the fruitful vine; we have seen the lame and the blind, and
have met the leper at the gate; we have seen the tiny lamp, such as the
wise and foolish virgins carried&mdash;lamps that need often to be refilled;
and we have seen the "whited sepulchres," "full of dead men's bones."
We have been impressed with the life-giving power of a fountain in a
barren land and can more fully realize the force of the promise that
the man who delighteth "in the law of the Lord" "shall be like a
tree planted by the rivers of water."</p>

<p>But no part of the Old Testament has been brought more vividly
to our minds than the twenty-third Psalm. Life is much the same
here to-day as it was two, three, four thousand years ago, and we have
seen innumerable flocks and have watched the sheep following the
shepherd with confidence as he, staff in hand, led them into new
pastures or from hillside to stream. No animal is more helpless than the
sheep and no guardian more tender than the shepherd. The sheep
know their master's voice, and we have several times seen a shepherd
carrying a lamb in his arms. The hills about Jerusalem, the springs,
the shepherds and their flocks, will rise before us whenever we read
again:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in
green pastures; He leadeth me beside the still waters."</p></blockquote>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>

<h3>GALILEE.</h3>


<p>The boat schedules&mdash;and they can not be ignored on the Palestine
coast&mdash;compelled us to reserve Galilee for the conclusion of our tour,
and it was an inappropriate ending, for while Jerusalem was the scene
of the crucifixion and ascension, the greater part of Christ's life was
spent in Galilee, and it was there that "most of His mighty works were
done." Nor is its history confined to the New Testament, for it has its
Carmel associated with the life of Elijah, and Mount Tabor where
Deborah's victory was won. Haifa, the seaport of Galilee, is built along
the front of Carmel on the edge of a bay which the mountain helps to
form, for Carmel, instead of being a peak, is really a long ridge but a
few hundred feet in height, jutting out into the sea at this point and
extending several miles to the southeast. A Roman Catholic monastery
is erected over a cave overlooking the Mediterranean, where Elijah is
said to have lived.</p>

<p>To the north of Carmel lies the plain of Esdraelon through which
the Kishon river flows. The road to Nazareth follows the south side of
this valley to a point some seven miles from the shore where the hills
of Galilee approach so near to Carmel as to leave but a narrow pass for
the river. Here the road crosses over to the north side of the valley,
and for the remainder of the distance winds upward over the hills, giving
a commanding view of Esdraelon. The upper part of the plain
is as beautiful a country as can be imagined&mdash;well watered, fertile
and thoroughly cultivated. The land is not held in severalty, as in
America, but by communities. The cultivators live in villages, built at
intervals around the edge of the valley, and the land is apportioned each
year by the village chief, no one receiving the same tract two years
in succession. As we looked down upon the valley we could distinguish
the different allotments as they lay in long strips of equal width.
Wheat is the chief product of the valley, although there are a few
olive orchards, and the mulberry tree is being planted. Oxen are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
the animals usually employed in cultivation, but we occasionally saw
a horse and an ox yoked together or a camel and an ox, and once a
camel and a donkey.</p>

<p>Jezreel is on this plain, at the foot of Mount Gilboa, where the middle
plain connects with the plain leading down to the Jordan between
Gilboa and Little Hermon. This is historic ground, for it was here
at a great spring which flows out from under Gilboa that Gideon
selected his gallant band.</p>

<p>The village of Nazareth, nestling among the hills of Galilee, must
always be a place of supreme interest to the Christian. Its location
was probably determined by the presence here of an unfailing spring,
now known as Mary's fountain. Dr. George Adam Smith, in his "Historical
Geography of the Holy Land," points out the relation between
the springs and the routes of travel and emphasizes the prominence
of Nazareth in the Bible times. Christ's boyhood and young manhood
were spent near a great highway, for the old Roman road from
Damascus to Egypt ran through the town. Caravans passed to and
fro laden with the riches of the Euphrates and the Nile; princes passed
that way on their royal journeys, and in time of war it was on the
route of armies. From a high hill just outside the town Christ could
look to the west and see the surf line on the shore of the Mediterranean,
to the east He could survey the walls of the chasm in which lay the
sea of Galilee, while to the northeast rose Hermon, the pride of the
mountains. Several of His parables fit quite naturally into the scenes
upon which He looked, and those parables were the more effective
because they were taken from the everyday life of the people. The
stony ground, the rocky roadways and the narrow strips of fertile soil
were woven into the Parable of the Sower, and some acquaintance
of His youth, following the merchantmen into Egypt or Mesopotamia,
may have been the original of the Prodigal Son.</p>

<p>Rev. Selah Merrill, our consul at Jerusalem, has refuted the statement
so frequently made that the Nazarenes were held in contempt.
He shows that there is no just foundation for the aspersions cast on
this section of Galilee. Mr. Merrill's book, "Galilee in the Time of
Christ," is, I may add, a very useful preparation for a trip through this
part of Palestine.</p>

<p>Chapels have been erected to mark the home of Joseph and Mary,
the carpenter shop and the rock where Christ met His disciples after
the resurrection, but one never feels certain about the identification of
places selected so long after the death of Christ and having no permanent
physical marks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<p>A few miles to the east of Nazareth is a village called Cana which
claims to be the "Cana of Galilee" where the first miracle was performed,
and a church has been erected over a well from which, it is argued,
the water was taken that was turned into wine, but two other villages
with similar names contest the honor with this Cana.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">A BEDOUIN.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The Sea of Galilee has a double claim to distinction. To its natural
beauty, which is unsurpassed, is added the glory of having furnished
the fishermen who were to become "fishers of men." Nearly seven
hundred feet below the level of the ocean and walled by high hills,
it has a character all its own, and its shores were the familiar haunts
of Him who by precept and example taught the nobleness of service.
The sea is some twelve miles in length by six or eight in breadth.
The Jordan pours into it the waters of Hermon and Lake Merom and
carries away its overflow to the Dead Sea. The Plain of Gennesaret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
includes nearly all the level land adjacent to it, save the Jordan valleys
above and below, and is so prominent a feature of the landscape that
its name is sometimes applied to the sea. The village of Magdala,
home of one of the Marys, is situated on the edge of this plain, but
is now only a collection of mud huts, each one bearing a booth of
boughs upon its flat roof. The house top is an important part of the
house in the Orient and furnishes a sleeping place for the occupants
during the warm summer nights. The village of Magdala, with the
land belonging to it, has recently been sold to a syndicate which proposes
to very much improve its cultivation.</p>

</div>

<p>A little farther south on the west side of the sea, is the city of
Tiberias, the only city still remaining of the ten or more that, two
thousand years ago, stretched along the shores. The city's name
gives evidence of its Roman origin, and it was once so important a
place that its name was a rival for Galilee in the designation of the
sea. Tiberias was one of the sacred cities of the Jews and to-day the
descendants of the Hebrew race constitute three-fourths of its population.
A Jewish society, of which Baron Rothschild is the patron, has
several schools here, and a number of the residents devote themselves
entirely to the study of the law. Near Tiberias are the hot springs spoken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
of by Josephus, and their healing waters still have a great reputation.
The bath houses are not kept as they would be in Europe or America,
but the mineral properties of the water make it very invigorating.</p>

<p>A Jewish synagogue
has been erected
near the hot
springs and the annual
feast in honor
of Rabbi Meyer was
celebrated there during
our stay in Tiberias.
As it was the
only feast of the kind
we had ever attended,
we found it exceedingly
interesting.
The devout Jews were
gathered in large
numbers, some coming
several days'
journey; many of
the men wore a long
curl in front of each
ear, a custom which
we first noticed in
Jerusalem. The feast
is an occasion of rejoicing
and there are
dancing, music and
merriment. A part
of the ceremony is
the burning of garments contributed by those in attendance, and
the right to light the fire is made a matter of auction. We went into
the room where the bidding was in progress and were informed that
more than ten dollars had already been offered for the honor. The
feast has many of the characteristics of a fair, the vendors of candles,
cakes, drinks and merchandise plying their trade and different delegations
marching with banners.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 250px;"><a name="arab" id="arab"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">AN ARAB MAIDEN.</p></div>
</div>

<p>There is at Tiberias a splendidly equipped hospital established by the
United Free Church of Scotland, and conducted by a skilful surgeon,
Dr. Torrance, and a corps of assistants; more than one hundred and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
fifty persons were treated the day we visited the hospital. Surely this
institution is a fitting memorial, and what more appropriate place for a
hospital than these shores where the lame were made whole, the deaf
were healed and the blind received their sight!</p>

<p>The site of Chorazin, the city which Christ denounced for unbelief
in connection with Capernaum and Bethsaida, is still a matter of dispute,
but Capernaum, where Christ dwelt during the greater part of His
ministry, has probably been identified. It is situated on the northeast
corner of Gennesaret,
close by the shore of
the sea. There is no
town there now and
no house save a Catholic
monastery, but
recent excavations
have unearthed the
foundations of a
building believed to
have been the Jewish
synagogue in which
Christ spoke. On one
of the stones of this
synagogue is a representation
of David's
seal and a pot of
manna; if this is in reality the synagogue in which Christ referred to
the bread of life, it may be true, as someone has suggested, that He
found His text, "Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness," in this
carving upon the stone.</p>

<p>There has been a great deal of discussion over the site of Bethsaida,
and some have argued that there were two towns of the same name,
one at the north end of the lake east of the mouth of the Jordan,
and the other on the west side not far from Capernaum. But both
towns have so completely disappeared that they can not be located
with any certainty.</p>

</div>

<p>Safed, another of the sacred cities of the Jews, lies some distance
west of the sea of Galilee but within sight of it, perched on a high
hill. It is so conspicuous a landmark and so often seen by the Great
Teacher that it may have suggested to His mind the illustration, "A
city that is set on a hill can not be hid."</p>

<p>The sea of Galilee, beautiful as it is with its clear water and its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
picturesque environment, is treacherous. Its surface is swept by sudden
gusts of wind and tempests often lash it until its waves beat high
upon the shore. A resident of Tiberias told us that he had seen it
when it might be mistaken for an ocean, so violently was it agitated,
and he bore testimony also to the unexpected squalls that visit it.
We spent two days on the sea, and in crossing it found the wind so
variable that probably half a dozen times the sail became useless and
it was necessary to resort to the oars. There was no great tempest
while we were there, and the waves did not "beat into the ship" but the
wind was at times contrary. The uncertainty of the weather has been
attributed to the numerous ravines or canyons which run down from
the mountains round about the sea, and as these are the same now
that they were two thousand years ago, travel upon the lake is attended
with the same risk that it was then.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">SALIM MOUSSA, WITH PARTY OF TOURISTS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In the time of Christ the sea of Galilee was the scene of busy life.
The population of the country described as Galilee has been estimated
to have been at that time about two and a half millions. The sea was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
covered with boats, built for fishing, for traffic, for war or for pleasure.
Josephus collected two hundred and thirty ships for one of his expeditions
upon the sea, and in a sea fight that took place there the number
killed on one side alone was given at from four to six thousand.</p>

<p>The sea was full of fish, and the Gospels furnish abundant proof of
the importance of fishing as an industry, a fact also established by outside
evidence. Dr. Merrill, in the book above referred to, says that
fish taken were not only sufficient to satisfy the local demands but
were packed and shipped to Jerusalem and even to cities along the
Mediterranean. The supply of fish has not yet been exhausted. Salim
Moussa, of Jaffa, the very efficient Arab dragoman furnished us by
Cook, supplied us with a net when we visited the sites of Capernaum
and Bethsaida and our son caught enough fish for our lunch. It was
a delightful outing that we had that day, gathering water-worn pebbles
from the beach, picking up shells, of which there are many varieties,
and feasting on fish fresh from the sea and on a lamb bought
from a Bedouin who was tending his flock near by.</p>

<p>The visit to the Horns of Hattin was reserved for the return trip,
the road from Nazareth to Tiberias passing near the hill which bears
this name. It was in 1157 the scene of a celebrated battle in which
Saladin won a victory over the Crusaders. This hill, by a tradition
which has come down from the time of the Crusaders, is styled the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
Mount of Beatitudes. There is nothing to determine just where the
Sermon on the Mount was delivered, but because the Horns of Hattin
have been associated with that wonderful discourse, I was anxious
to visit the place. There is no road leading to this eminence and the
bridle paths can scarcely be followed. The ground is covered by
boulders and broken stones, half concealed by grass and thistles and
flowers. The guide stepped over a large snake before we had gone
far, and as it was of a very poisonous variety, he felt that he had
had a narrow escape. From a distance the top of the hill is saddle-shaped,
and the two horns have given it its name, but on the top there
is a large circular basin, probably two hundred yards in diameter,
and the rim of this basin was once walled and a citadel built there.</p>

<p>The view from this mount is one of the most beautiful I have ever
seen. To the north, Hermon rises in grandeur, his summit covered
with snow; the intervening space is filled with hills except in the
immediate foreground where the sea of Galilee sparkles in the sun.
At the foot of the mount stretches a verdant valley, and from the valley
a defile runs down to the sea. This opening gives a view of the
shore where Capernaum and Bethsaida are supposed to have stood,
and one of the roads from the sea to Nazareth follows the stream
which flows through this defile. On the opposite side of the Mount,
Tabor can be seen, and beyond, the hills of Samaria. There is inspiration
in this commingling of hill and vale and sea and sky.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Whether, as a matter of fact, Christ, "seeing the multitude," ascended
to this place I know not, but it furnishes an environment
fit for the sublime code of morality presented in the Sermon on the
Mount. No other philosophy has ever touched so high a point or
presented so noble a conception of human life. In it purity of heart is
made the test, mercy is enjoined, humility emphasized, forgiveness
commanded and love made the law of action. In that Sermon He
pointed out the beginnings of evil, rebuked those who allow themselves
to be engrossed by the care of the body and gave to the world a
brief, simple and incomparable prayer which the Christian world repeats
in unison.</p>

<p>If in other places He relieved those whose sufferings came through
the infirmities of the flesh, He here offered a balm for the healing of
the nations.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>

<h3>GREECE&mdash;THE WORLD'S TEACHER.</h3>


<p>Nothing so impresses the visitor to Greece&mdash;not the waters of the
Ægean sea, with their myriad hues; not the Acropolis, eloquent
with ruins; not even the lovely site of Athens itself&mdash;as the part
which little Greece has played in the instruction of the world. With
an area of less than twenty-five thousand square miles, not half of
which is productive, and with a population of less than two and a
half millions, this diminutive nation has a history without a parallel.</p>

<p>There is scarcely a department of thought in which Greece has
not been the pioneer, and in many things she has set an example
which subsequent generations have but imperfectly followed. If in
Egypt one is awed by the evidences of antiquity; if in Palestine
he is made reverent by the spiritual association connected with Judea,
Galilee and Samaria; in Greece he bows with profound respect to the
mighty influence exerted by this single people upon civilization.</p>

<p>The signs along the streets recall the alphabet with which the student
of the classics struggles when he takes up the dead languages&mdash;and
yet, the Greek language can hardly be called dead, for while it is
the spoken tongue of but a comparatively small number, it has found
a glorious resurrection in nearly all the languages of Europe. In
fact, it has so many merits that we are constantly complimenting
it by returning to it for the nomenclature of philosophy, science
and art.</p>

<p>Of those who still speak the language of Herodotus, Homer, Socrates
and Demosthenes, a majority live outside of Greece, for the
Greek colonies planted around the eastern end of the Mediterranean
form a considerable, as well as an influential, portion of the population.
Greek colonization, by the way, was of an enduring kind. Those
who went out into distant fields did not go as individual bees (official
or commercial) to gather honey and return with it to the parent hive;
they went out rather in swarms to found cities, develop countries and
establish new centers for the spread of Greek influence. They identified
themselves with the land to which they went; they became an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
integral part of the population, and, by virtue of their inherent superiority,
they gradually substituted the language, the ideas, and the
customs of their native land for those which they found. So securely
did they build that neither the Roman nor the Turk was able to obliterate
their work. The people bowed before the storm, but continued
Greek, and to-day in Alexandria, Asia Minor and Constantinople,
Hellenic influence is still felt.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="parthenon" id="parthenon"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE PARTHENON.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The ancient Greeks sought to perfect the human form, and it is
not to be wondered at that the marble models of strength, grace and
beauty have been unearthed where the Olympian games inspired a
rivalry in physical development. The games were established nearly
eight hundred years before the beginning of the Christian era, and
during the nation's independent existence they were held in such
high esteem that the laurel wreath of victory was the greatest reward
within the reach of the youth of the country. Each city had its stadium,
some of them of immense size. The one at Athens seated fifty
thousand spectators, and the enthusiasm aroused by the contests was
scarcely less than that which at Rome greeted the gladiators. By the generosity
of a rich Greek the stadium at Athens has recently been restored
at a cost of more than a million dollars. The race course is six hundred
and seventy feet long and a little more than a hundred feet in width,
and the seats are of Pentelic marble. Notwithstanding its great capacity
it can not contain the crowds that assemble to witness the athletic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
games, renewed there in 1896 by the International Athletic Association.
Our country has the distinction of having led in the contest
of 1896 and again in the contest held at Athens last April. Our
representatives won eleven prizes each time, and I found that these
victories had very favorably impressed the people of Athens.</p>

<p>The stadium is not the only splendid monument to the public
spirit of the modern Greeks. The academy of science and the library
are magnificent buildings, each costing more than the restoration
of the stadium. They illustrate the best in Grecian architecture,
reproducing the Corinthian, the Doric, and the Ionic. They are of
Pentelic marble and would be worthy of a place in any city of the
world. The library contains several hundred thousand volumes and has
all the modern equipment. Athens has a population of but little more
than a hundred thousand, and it is doubtful whether there is another
city of its size that can boast of as large an expenditure of private
capital in public buildings. The mountain which has supplied Athens
with marble for twenty-five hundred years is only a few miles from
the city and its quarries are still unexhausted.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="athens" id="athens"></a>
<img src="images/ill171.jpg" width="450" height="247" alt="athens" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE ACROPOLIS AT ATHENS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Modern Athens is very attractive; its streets are paved and clean;
its business houses are large and well built; its government buildings
are substantial, and its private residences give evidence of taste. We
were there in the season of flowers and we saw them blooming in
profusion everywhere. Numerous statues adorn the streets and parks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
the most noted being the statue of Byron, erected in memory of his
unselfish devotion to Greek independence.</p>

<p>The soldiers and policemen have adopted the costume of the ancient
Greeks, but otherwise the people dress like the people of northern
Europe.</p>

<p>As one approaches Athens for the first time, his eye is sure to
search for the "temple-crowned" Acropolis&mdash;the hill which art and
religion combined to make immortal. It rises from the plain much
as Chapultepec rises from the plain of Mexico. It is about five hundred
feet high and, at the top, two hundred yards in length. It must have
been surpassingly beautiful when the Parthenon was completed&mdash;that
great treasury which has not only supplied the art galleries of the
world with marvels of beauty in stone, but has given law to the
architects from that day to this. Pericles, who deserves the credit
for the construction of the Parthenon, can be pardoned for exulting
in his work.</p>

<p>To-day, the Acropolis is a picture of desolation, but the few columns
that remain bear witness to its departed glory. Lord Elgin carried
away at one time two hundred and fifty feet of the sculptured frieze,
and scarcely any of its columns, capitals, cornice and pediment would
have remained but for the size and weight of the masses of marble.
The pillage that for nearly twenty centuries has been robbing Greece
of her priceless works of art can be understood when it is stated that
one Roman conqueror celebrated his victory by exhibiting in his
triumphant procession two hundred and fifty wagon loads of Greek
pictures and statues, and that these wagons were followed by three
thousand men each bearing some trophy taken from the cities of
Greece.</p>

<p>And yet in spite of the grand larceny which has been perpetrated
against this unfortunate land the museum at Athens contains enough
of the beautiful in marble and bronze to make any nation conspicuous
in the realm of art. Within two years some notable additions have been
made to the collection; a life-sized bronze statue has been unearthed
and a marble figure, half buried in the sands of the sea, has been
rescued. The latter is perfect in the portions protected by the sand
but was disintegrating where it came into contact with the waves.</p>

<p>The readers of these articles are too well informed in regard to
the discoveries of Dr. Schliemann to make it necessary to refer to
his work in detail. One room of the museum contains the gold
ornaments which he gathered from five tombs, and they are sufficient
to show the extended use made of this metal in the arts. They consist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
of ear rings, finger rings, bracelets, necklaces, head ornaments,
vases, cups, coins, etc. A pair of cups which attract special attention
bear in relief the figures of bulls&mdash;the animals being equal in form to
the best breeds of to-day. On one cup they are being led to the sacrifice
and on the other they are bound at the altar.</p>

<p>Besides these statues of renown and the casts of those which have
been removed, there are many specimens of ancient pottery by
which one can trace the rise in artistic taste and skill. Some of the
earliest statues in stone and clay bear a striking resemblance to those
of Egypt.</p>

<p>Second only in interest to the Acropolis is Mars Hill, a rocky summit
two-thirds of the height of the Acropolis. Here the ancient
court of the Areopagus, composed of the most eminent of the Athenians,
held its sessions. Here under the dome of the sky the most important
cases were tried and life and death hung upon the decree of the court.
Here, also, Paul's great speech to the "men of Athens" was delivered,
his text being found in the altar erected to "the unknown god."</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="mars" id="mars"></a>
<img src="images/ill172.jpg" width="450" height="206" alt="mars" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">MARS HILL.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Only a little distance from Mars Hill is the stone platform from
which the orators of Greece addressed the people. A level, shelf-like
space was formed near the top of the hill where a few thousand could
congregate, and here the citizens listened while the greatest of all public
speakers poured forth his eloquence. It was worth a trip to Athens
to view the spot where Demosthenes delivered the oration on the Crown
and the Philippics, which have been the pattern set before the student
for twenty-two hundred years. In the marshalling of facts, in the
grouping of arguments, in the use of invective and in the arranging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
of climaxes he is still the teacher. Someone has drawn a distinction
between Cicero and Demosthenes, saying that when the former spoke
the people said: "How well Cicero speaks," while, when Demosthenes
spoke, they said: "Let us go against Phillip!" Demosthenes' style was
more convincing than ornate; his purpose was to arouse, not merely
to please, and from the accounts that have come down to us his
delivery was suited to his language. He, in fact, gave to action the
highest place among the requisites of effective speech. We recalled
the saying of Demosthenes when we listened to the excited tones and
watched the gesticulations of the boatmen who thronged about our
ship in the harbor of Piræus. The physician who came aboard to
examine the passengers gave us even a better illustration of "action,"
although his gestures were more forcible than graceful, possibly
because he addressed himself to the captain of the ship instead of to
the multitude.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">DEMOSTHENES' PLATFORM.</p></div>
</div>

<p>On the shore of the Ægean sea, between Athens and the harbor,
at a place where Demosthenes may have tested his voice against the
tumult of the waves, I gathered some pebbles. I can not prove that they
are the identical ones used by him to overcome the impediment in
his speech, but they are at least a reminder of the toilsome struggle
through which he passed before his name was known to fame.</p>

<p>It was a disappointment to find so little to mark the site of the
academy where Socrates and Plato met their disciples. These philosophers
have made such an impression upon the thought of the world
that I had hoped to find some spot clearly identified as the place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
where they taught. An old house now stands on a treeless tract over
which they are said to have walked in their daily discussions, but it is
a modern one. A gate admits to the grounds, although no wall
incloses them. It is much easier to picture Demosthenes speaking from
the rostrum which still remains, than to imagine Socrates propounding
here his questions and elaborating the method of reasoning to which
his name has been given.</p>

<p>There is an old cemetery within the limits of the present city where
recent excavation has brought to light numerous tombs ornamented
with sculpture. Some of the groups of statuary and urns have been
left where they were found, while others have been given a place in the
museum. These are additional proof of the number of those who
handled the chisel in the days of Phidias.</p>

<p>No spot is identified with Herodotus, the Father of History, or with
Thucydides who, with Herodotus, has been the instructor of later chroniclers.
Except the remains of the theatres, there is nothing to recall
the tragedies of Euripides, Æschylus and Sophocles or the comedies
of the Aristophanes; and no place is pointed out as the site of the
studio of Parrhasius or Zeuxis, though the lessons which they taught
the world have not been forgotten. While the guide does not pretend
to know the house in which Homer lived or where he wrote his deathless
songs, the traveler who passes through the Hellespont can see the
plains of ill-fated Troy, and during his stay in Greece his memory
runs over the heroes of the Iliad and the Odyssey.</p>

<p>There are no physical evidences of the life work of Lycurgus and
Solon, yet the laws which they promulgated are the heritage of mankind.
Salamis remains, and if the naval battle which Themistocles won
had had no other effect than to furnish Pericles with a theme for his
great funeral orations, it would still have been worthy of remembrance.
The battlefield of Marathon which gave Miltiades a place among the
world's generals is also unchanged. It is about twenty-five miles from
Athens, and the story, told in marble, of the Greek who carried the
news of the victory to Athens and died from exhaustion amid the
shouts of his countrymen, has led to the incorporation of a twenty-five
mile race in the athletic games when they are held at Athens. In 1896
the race was won by a Greek (much to the satisfaction of the audience),
who made the run from Marathon to the city in two hours and forty-five
minutes.</p>

<p>The pass at Thermopylæ is also to be seen, and the heroism of the
three hundred Spartans who, under the leadership of Leonidas, offered
up their lives there for their country, continues to be an inspiration.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
They failed to stay the onward march of Xerxes, but who can measure
the value of their example?</p>

<p>Corinth, as of old, still guards the entrance to the Peloponnesus;
but notwithstanding the canal, which, at this point, connects the
Ægean Sea with the Gulf of Corinth, the city has only a small population.</p>

<p>Corinth brings to memory the part Greece played in the spread of
Christianity. It was not enough that this country led the world in
statecraft and oratory, in poetry and history, in philosophy and
literature, in art and in athletics, she was also one of the first mission
fields of the apostles. It was to the Corinthians that Paul wrote
the Epistles in which love is given the first place among the virtues,
and it was Greece that gave her name to one of the great branches of
the Christian Church.</p>

<p>A democrat may be pardoned for cherishing a high regard for
the land that coined the word, democracy. The derivation of the word&mdash;from
<em>demos</em>, the people, and <em>kratein</em>, to rule&mdash;makes it an appropriate
one to describe a government based upon popular will. And
as governments more and more recognize the citizen as the sovereign,
and the people as the source of all political power, the world's debt
to Greece will be more and more fully appreciated. She not only
gave to language a word accurately expressing the idea of self-government,
but she proved by experience the wisdom of trusting the people
with the management of all public affairs.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>

<h3>THE BYZANTINE CAPITAL.</h3>


<p>It is impossible to convey to the reader any adequate idea of the
beauties of the Bosphorus at the point where Constantine located the
capital of the Byzantine empire. The best way to approach it is by
the sea, and as the traveler usually enters from the west, he sails through
the Dardanelles, known in ancient times as the Hellespont, passes
through the sea of Marmora and enters the Bosphorus between Constantinople,
on the one side, and Skutari on the other. The Bosphorus
itself is between fifteen and twenty miles long and very deep. It is
the connecting link between the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmora
and the hills that jut into it on either side are nearly all covered with
towns and villas. The water is as clear as the water of a lake, and
fish may be seen at a great distance below the surface. A ride through
the Bosphorus reminds one of a trip up the Hudson, although the
former has the advantage in the depth of the stream, in the transparency
of the water, in the height of the banks and in the irregularity
of the course. In fact, the channel contains so many curves that
one seems to be passing through a succession of lakes.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>A little more than half way between the Sea of Marmora and the
Black Sea, on the north bank, is Therapia, the summer capital, to which
the officials repair when the warm weather begins, and upon the same
bank, about half way between Constantinople and Therapia, is
Roberts College, an institution for boys, established and maintained
by American philanthropy. It occupies a promontory which overlooks
the Bosphorus at its narrowest point, the point at which Mohammed
II crossed over from Asia, when in 1453 he succeeded in capturing
Constantinople.</p>

<p>The Golden Horn is the name given to an arm of the Bosphorus
which, leaving that strait a few miles from the Sea of Marmora,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
stretches northward five or six miles to receive a stream called the
Sweet Waters of Europe. It may have been that the Golden Horn at
one time rivaled the Bosphorus in beauty, but it does so no longer.
Full of ships and boats of every description, from war vessels to
canoes, and polluted by the sewage of two cities, it disappoints as much
as the Bosphorus delights.</p>

<p>The city of Constantinople is divided by the Golden Horn, Stamboul,
the Turkish city lying on the west, and Galata and Pera, the foreign
quarters, lying on the east. Skutari stretches along the Asiatic side
of the Bosphorus, and the navies and merchant vessels of all the world
could ride in safety in the waters adjacent to these three cities.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="sofia" id="sofia"></a>
<img src="images/ill175.jpg" width="450" height="222" alt="sofia" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">ST. SOFIA AT CONSTANTINOPLE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In the seventh century, <small>B. C.</small>, a small colony of Greeks under the lead
of Byzas settled at Cape Bosphorus, now the site of Stamboul, and in the
rise and fall of the dynasties of the east, it has played an important
part. Being on the boundary line between Asia and Europe and guarding
the water communication between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean,
it possesses strategic advantages which statesmen and warriors
have been quick to recognize. The Persians always wanted it
and several times captured it. The Greeks were continually taking
it and losing it; Phillip of Macedon laid siege to it and in so doing
furnished Demosthenes with a theme for some of his greatest speeches.
There is a tradition that Phillip would have succeeded, in spite of the
aid given by the Athenians, but for the barking of dogs, which apprised
the inhabitants of a night assault. As the dogs were set to barking,
not by the enemy, but by the moon which rose just in time to save the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
city, the Byzantines adopted the crescent as their emblem and it has
continued to be the emblem of Turkey, having been retained by
the Turks after their victory.</p>

<p>Alexander the Great became master of the Bosphorus, and later
Byzantium fell into the hands of the Romans. After a checkered
career of two centuries it was taken by Constantine, who decided to
make it the capital of the Roman world, and his own name has been
given to it, although he intended to call it New Rome. No one can
doubt the political wisdom of the first Christian emperor in putting
the seat of government at this place. If Europe, Asia and Africa are
ever brought together under one government or under one confederation,
Constantinople will be the natural and necessary capital. The
shores of Africa, southern Europe and Asia Minor are washed by
the Mediterranean and by its gulfs and bays; the Black Sea is the
outlet of southern Russia and part of Asia Minor, and the new
railroad which is being built to connect Europe with the Euphrates
and India, crosses the Bosphorus here. When this road is finished,
it will be possible to go from London to India in about six days, and
one of the Turkish governors expressed the hope that it would be
completed within six or seven years.</p>

<p>Constantine built a magnificent cathedral, one of the greatest ever
constructed, it being his purpose to surpass any house of worship that
man had reared. It is in the form of a Greek cross and was originally
rich in mosaics, some of which still remain. The dome is one of the
largest in the world. This cathedral, called St. Sophia, fell into the
hands of the Mohammedans when Constantinople was taken and is
now used as a mosque. When hope of successful resistance was gone,
the Christians of Constantinople crowded into the cathedral&mdash;some have
estimated the number as high as a hundred thousand, but that seems
hardly possible&mdash;praying that the church might at least be spared,
but the leader of the Turks rode into the building on his charger,
and, striking one of the pillars with his sword, exclaimed; "There is
no God but Allah and Mohammed is his prophet!" Then followed a
slaughter so cruel and bloody that the Christians never recall the day
without indulging the hope that the building may some day return to
the possession of those who cherish the faith of its founder.</p>

<p>Constantinople is full of mosques, their minarets rising above all
other buildings, but none of them possess for either Christian or Moslem
the importance that attaches to St. Sophia.</p>

<p>The modern mosques lack the stateliness of Constantine's building,
and are not so rich in their ornamentation as some of the mosques of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a><br /><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
India. There is one, however, near the upper end of the Golden
Horn which is regarded by the Turks as especially sacred because it
is the burial place of the first Mohammedan (a standard bearer of
Mahomet) who attempted the capture of Constantinople. Each sultan
visits that mosque as he enters upon his reign, and Christians are not
permitted to use the street leading to the mosque. The sultan visits
St. Sophia once a year, but he is in such fear of assassination that he
usually has a street cleared for his passage and then quietly goes by
water to elude the crowd.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><a name="bosp" id="bosp"></a>
<img src="images/ill176.jpg" width="600" height="349" alt="bosp" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE BOSPHORUS AT CONSTANTINOPLE</p></div>
</div>

<p>The first settlement at Constantinople, or at Byzantine, as it was
originally called in honor of its founder, was made at what is now
known as Seraglio Point, an elevation which extends into the Bosphorus
between the Sea of Marmora and the Golden Horn. It commands
the best view of any place in the city. The historian, Bancroft,
visited this spot and was so impressed by the magnificence of the panorama
spread out before him that he stood gazing at it for an hour.
This was the site selected for the royal palace, and the kings, emperors
and sultans lived here until recent years, but it is so exposed to the
attack of any hostile fleet that the sultan's palace has, as a matter of precaution,
been removed to the hills back of Galata, and Seraglio Point
is now a sort of curiosity shop. It is visited with difficulty, permission
having to be obtained from the sultan himself, upon application of the
diplomatic representative of the nation to which the visitor belongs.
By the courtesy of our legation we obtained a permit and found it full
of interest. One of the buildings contains a very old library, another
is a reproduction of a Persian summer house which, a former sultan
having admired, his chief eunuch had removed to Constantinople
without his master's knowledge.</p>

<p>The most important building on the Point, however, is the treasury
where the crown jewels, ornamented arms, royal gifts and the robes of
former sultans are kept. It would require more space than that allotted
to a dozen articles to describe even the more important pieces of this
collection. One room contains two thrones brought from Persia, one
of which must have rivaled the famous Peacock Throne of Delhi. It
is of unusual size and literally covered with rubies, emeralds and pearls,
arranged in graceful patterns. The seat is of crimson velvet embroidered
with gold and pearls. The other throne, while smaller, is even
more richly ornamented; it is incrusted with larger jewels and has a
canopy, from the center of which is suspended an emerald of enormous
size.</p>

<p>Along the walls of one room were exhibited the costumes of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
various sultans from Mohammed II to the present. Nowhere else have
we seen such evidences of Oriental splendor in dress. The robes of
state are flowered and figured and heavy with gold; the turbans are
huge&mdash;sometimes fifteen inches in height and breadth&mdash;and adorned
with aigrettes of great value. One of these ornaments contains three
stones, a ruby and two emeralds as large as pigeons' eggs and without
a flaw. With each robe is the sword or dagger carried by the sultan
and each has a jeweled handle. While the robes differ in color and
design&mdash;as star differeth from star in glory&mdash;and while the aigrettes
and sword handles vary in pattern, all are on the same scale and show
lavish expenditure. They are in striking contrast with the last of the
series, which is simply a red military uniform covered with gold braid.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="smoking" id="smoking"></a>
<img src="images/ill177.jpg" width="450" height="360" alt="smoking" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">SMOKING THE HUBBLE-BUBBLE PIPE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The treasury contains numerous portraits of sultans and family
trees, presenting the heads of the present royal line. It seems that
nearly all of the Mohammedan rulers wore a full beard, and some of
them had strong faces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides the swords of the sultans, there are in the treasury innumerable
other swords with jeweled handles, and with scabbards inlaid
with gold, silver and gems. There are guns also of every description,
many of them engraved and ornamented with gold and silver. One
fortification gun bears upon the barrel quotations from the Koran
written in gold.</p>

<p>Then there are jewel boxes, vessels of gold and vessels of silver, rare
china, some of it set with jewels, not to speak of enameled ware and
embroideries. Many of these pieces were gifts sent or brought by other
rulers, for in the Orient the gift is as indispensable in dealing with the
sovereign as "baksheesh" is in dealing with the subordinate Turkish
official.</p>

<p>When we had finished the inspection of Seraglio Point, we were
conducted to one of the reception rooms and refreshed with a jam made
of rose leaves, and this was followed by Turkish coffee. Turkish coffee
by the way, is very different from the coffee of the Occident. The
berry is ground or pounded until it is as fine as flour; it is then put
into water and raised to the boiling point and cooled three times. It
is usually served hot, and is very black and so thick that at least half
of the small cup is sediment.</p>

<p>The streets of Constantinople are narrow, crooked and dirty. There
is no park system, and the cemeteries scattered through the city, being
shaded with cypress trees, furnish about the only picnic grounds for
the people. It is not an unusual sight to see a gay party spreading
its lunch amid the tombs. A Mohammedan graveyard is full of
headstones as well as trees, and on top of the stone is often
carved a fez or a turban. While most of this stony head wear is
unadorned, one sees occasionally a painted fez, red being the popular
color.</p>

<p>There is one park, called the Sweet Waters of Europe, and extending
along the stream which bears that name, where the Turkish women
congregate&mdash;especially on Friday afternoon. As might be expected,
the men have formed the habit of driving in the park on these days
in order to catch a glimpse of the women, for Turkish women live
in such seclusion that they are seldom seen. They wear veils, but
as we visited the park, we can testify that the veils are not always
heavy enough to conceal the features. When the eye is especially
lustrous or the face more comely than usual, the veil is occasionally
lifted.</p>

<p>The ride to and from the park also gives one an opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
to see a great many fine teams perfectly matched, for the Turk has
caught the Arab's fondness for the horse.</p>

<p>The bazaars of Constantinople repay a visit, though quite like the
bazaars of Cairo and Damascus. The booths are more substantially
built and more commodious, and the labyrinth of streets and alleys
which form the old bazaar are all under roof. As these passages
wander about aimlessly, one can easily become lost in them. While
one cannot rely upon the first price given, the vendors have a reputation
for honesty, and a lady told us of having had her attention
called to a mistake of five dollars in change and of having the money
returned to her when she next visited the bazaar.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="robert" id="robert"></a>
<img src="images/ill178.jpg" width="450" height="317" alt="robert" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">ROBERTS COLLEGE, NEAR CONSTANTINOPLE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>I mentioned the Oriental dog in speaking of Damascus; he forces
himself upon public attention in Constantinople also. The dogs of
this city act as scavengers and are relied upon to keep the streets
neat&mdash;a vain reliance, for while they devour everything that they
can digest, they are not sufficient for the task imposed upon them.
These dogs are wolfish in appearance and generally yellow in color.
Lacking the fidelity which the dog is accustomed to show to his master,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
these animals roam about the street and haunt the places where food
is most likely to be found. The people of Constantinople assert that
the dogs maintain a police force of their own, and, dividing the city
into districts, enforce their own regulations. If a strange dog comes
into the district, he is at once driven out by the canine sentinel on
that beat.</p>

<p>The Golden Horn is spanned by two pontoon bridges (if the word
spanned can be used in connection with such a bridge) and the one
connecting the business portions of Stamboul and Galata is a veritable
mint, the income from the tolls amounting at times to two thousand
dollars per day. It is owned by the government, and bridge companies
have offered to replace it with a good bridge for the income of
two or three years, but it is so profitable that it is allowed to remain
in its present dilapidated condition.</p>

<p>One can stand on this bridge and see all phases of life and all types
of human beings. All nationalities meet in Constantinople and all
colors are represented here. Two streams pass each other on this
bridge from dawn to dark, and there is no better place to study the
tragedies and the comedies of life as they are depicted in the faces of
the people.</p>

<p>The haste that is to be seen on the bridge is in sharp contrast with
the air of leisure which pervades the coffee houses and the side streets
where fezzed or turbaned Turks meet to smoke their hubble-bubble
pipes (the smoke being drawn through water) and discuss such topics
as are not forbidden by the extremely watchful government under
which they live.</p>

<p>Before leaving Constantinople we crossed over to the Asiatic side
to visit the American school for girls, which has enjoyed a prosperous
existence for more than twenty years. It is another evidence of the
far-reaching sympathy of the Christian people of the United States and
adds to the feeling of pride with which an American citizen contemplates
the spreading influence of his country.</p>

<p>When we recrossed the Bosphorus we bade farewell to Asia,
within whose borders we had spent about seven months. They have
been wonderfully instructive months, and we have enjoyed the experiences
through which we have passed, but we can not say that we
have fallen in love with Asiatic food. We have been afraid of the
raw vegetables; we have distrusted the water, unless it was boiled,
and we have sometimes been skeptical about the meat. The butter has
not always looked inviting, and our fondness for cream has not been
increased by the sight of the goats driven from door to door and milked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
in the presence of the purchaser. The bread was not a rival for the
Vienna brand, and the cooking has not been up to western standards.
But the hen&mdash;long life to her! She has been our constant friend. When
all else failed we could fall back upon the boiled egg with a sense of
security and a feeling of satisfaction. If I am not henceforth a
poultry fancier in the technical sense of the term, I shall return
with an increased respect for the common, everyday barnyard fowl.
There are many differences between the east and the west&mdash;difference
in race characteristics, differences in costume, differences in ideals
of life, of government and religion, but we all meet at the breakfast
table&mdash;the egg, like "a touch of nature, makes the whole world kin."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>

<h3>IN THE LAND OF THE TURK.</h3>


<p>I was unable to crowd into the last article all of our experiences
in the land of the Turk, so I devoted it to Constantinople, leaving
to this paper the discussion of the sultan, his religion and his government.
Abdul Hamud Kahn II., is the present sultan of Turkey. He
is sixty-three years old and has occupied the throne for nearly thirty
years. His family has been supreme in Constantinople for twenty-four
generations&mdash;ever since the taking of the city by the Mohammedans.
He is not only an absolute monarch throughout the domain
of Turkey, but he is the spiritual head of the Moslem Church. His
power is really due more to his religious position than to his sovereignty.
He is credited with doing more for the spread of education
than his predecessors, but he can hardly be called an enthusiastic
patron of learning. He endeavors to maintain cordial relations with
European powers and is on especially good terms with Emperor
William. When he wants to show himself friendly to a nation he
appoints some representative of that nation to a place in the army,
navy or other department of the public service at a high salary, and
he gives decorations to such foreigners as he desires to honor.</p>

<p>Every Friday about midday he goes to the mosque near the palace to
pray and the occasion is one of great interest to those who are fortunate
enough to obtain admission to the grounds, as his journey from
the palace to the church is a brilliant pageant. Tickets of admission
must be secured through the diplomatic representatives, and we are
under obligations to the American legation for an opportunity to be
present.</p>

<p>As early as eleven o'clock, bands, companies of infantry, troops of
cavalry and bodies of police could be seen marching toward the
mosque. From the right, over a hill, came the cavalry mounted on
white horses and carrying pennants of scarlet upon their spears; from
another direction marched the custodians of the sacred banner, a
flag of black silk with texts from the Koran embroidered upon it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
in silver, then others and still others came. Before time for the sultan
to appear several thousand soldiers had assembled and been assigned to
their respective stations by officers in attractive uniforms. Drawn
up several lines deep, they guarded every entrance to the sacred
precincts.</p>

<p>It was a gorgeous spectacle, for the Turk is a fine looking soldier.
This may account for the tenderness with which the sultan is handled
by the "powers." And there is sufficient variety in the uniforms to
lend picturesqueness to the scene. The invited guests occupied a large
front room and an adjoining garden, from which they had a clear
view of the broad street, freshly sprinkled with sand, and of the mosque
about a block away. When all things were in readiness the castle
gates swung open and the ladies of the court, closely veiled and accompanied
by the children, proceeded to the mosque in closed carriages
drawn by beautiful Arabian horses. As usual in Oriental countries,
the members of the household were attended by black eunuchs.</p>

<p>At the appointed hour a black robed figure appeared upon the
minaret and an echo-like call to prayer floated down the street. This
was the signal for which the spectators had waited and all eyes turned
at once to the palace gate through which, in double line, marched
the high officials, preceded by a band and followed by the sultan's
bodyguard and the sultan himself in a carriage with his minister
of war. The officers saluted, the soldiers cheered, the visitors raised
their hats, and the sultan bowed and smiled.</p>

<p>Hamud II. is mild in appearance and his black beard is but slightly
streaked with grey. He does not look strong and his figure seems
diminutive when contrasted with that of his minister of war. His
imperial majesty, as he is styled, remained in the mosque for nearly
half an hour. When he at last came out he entered a phaeton with his
eldest son and, taking the lines himself, drove back to the palace behind
one of the handsomest teams in Europe. The horses are a very dark,
almost black, dappled chestnut sorrel, with silver mane and tail. They
are perfectly matched, weigh thirteen or fourteen hundred pounds
and the shining coats give evidence of constant care.</p>

<p>We obtained permission to visit the sultan's stables and saw a few,
not all, of his more than a thousand horses. The finest, of course, are
the Arabian stallions, of which he has quite a number, the best of the
breed. In one room we saw a hundred or more saddles and bridles,
many of them richly ornamented. In the collection are two Texas
saddles presented by Minister Terrell when he represented our government
in Constantinople.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span></p>

<p>Before passing from the Selamlik, as the procession is called, it may
not be out of place to remind the reader that the ceremonies were
interrupted less than a year ago by the explosion of a bomb close
to the line of march. Near the mosque is a large gate which the procession
passes. Outside of this gate a guard is stationed, but carriages
are allowed to line up back of the guard. On that occasion
a new carriage made its appearance and secured a place as near the
gate as was permitted. This carriage, having been expressly built
for the purpose, had a large bomb concealed under the driver's seat.
The man in charge of the enterprise represented to the driver that
he wanted to take a photograph of the procession just as the sultan
passed, and instructed him to press the button at the proper time.
He did so and a number of those near the sultan were killed, but the
sultan himself escaped without injury. Greater precaution is taken now
than before, but the head of the church still makes his weekly pilgrimage
to the mosque, thus maintaining unbroken a record covering
nearly three decades.</p>

<p>I hope I shall be pardoned for giving so much space to so military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
and spectacular a performance, but it is a scene that can be witnessed
nowhere else and is the last reminder of the pomp and show that
formerly characterized all the empires of the east. It may seem a
little incongruous that so many swords and muskets should be brought
into requisition at a religious function, but it must be remembered
that Mohammedanism recognizes the sword as a legitimate agency
in the spread of its creed.</p>

<p>I have been tempted to refer to the tenets of Mohammedanism
before, for we began to meet the followers of the prophet as soon as
we entered Asia, but it seemed more appropriate to consider the subject
in connection with the high personage who combines the authority
of a temporal ruler with the dignity of Caliph.</p>

<p>The Koran is the book of the law and the Moslem is not permitted
to doubt its plenary inspiration. After Mahomet announced that he
had been selected as a messenger of the Lord and commissioned to
preach he began giving out what he declared to be revelations. They
read as commands to him to "speak" and to "say." His central idea
was the unity of God and his special mission the overthrow of idolatry.
He emphasized the resurrection of the body and the Koran is full of
promises to the faithful and as full of threats against the infidel. In
the Koran God is quoted as promising: "For those who are devout
are prepared with their Lord gardens through which rivers flow;
therein shall they continue forever; and they shall enjoy wives free
from impurity and the favor of God." For the infidel, which includes
all who do not accept the prophet, the following punishment is
threatened: "Verily, those who disbelieve our signs, we will surely
cast to be broiled in hell fire; so often as their skin shall be well
burned, we will give them other skins in exchange, that they may
taste the sharper punishment; for God is mighty and wise."</p>

<p>Through the Koran he not only credited God with the creation
and with a care for all the wants of man, but he also declared that
God deceived and misled some while He guided others aright. In one
revelation he makes God say: "They who accuse our signs of falsehood,
are deaf and dumb, walking in darkness; God will lead into
error whom He pleaseth, and whom He pleaseth He will put in the
right way."</p>

<p>He accepted the Old Testament and counted Christ among the
prophets. In one of the revelations, he declares that he is commanded
to say: "We believe in God and that which hath been sent down unto
us, and that which hath been sent down unto Abraham, and Ishmael
and Isaac, and Jacob, and the tribes, and that which was delivered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
unto Moses, and Jesus, and that which was delivered unto the prophets
from their Lord; we make no distinction between any of them and to
God we are resigned." In the beginning of his ministry, his revelations
were friendly to the Jews, whom he at first attempted to conciliate,
but when they rejected him, he gave out other revelations which
treated the Jews with great severity. He started out to rely upon
reason and an appeal to conscience, and by persuasion he formed the
nucleus of his church, but as he grew stronger his revelations became
more warlike in tone and at last he committed the Almighty to relentless
warfare against the infidel. Here is the language which he imputes
to God: "O Prophet, wage war against the unbelievers and the
hypocrites, and be severe unto them, for their dwelling shall be hell;
an unhappy journey shall it be thither!" At another time, he told
his followers that they would be asked whether it was proper to war
in the sacred month and he instructed them to answer: "The temptation
to idolatry is more grievous than to kill in the sacred months."</p>

<p>On many questions the advice which he gave through the Koran
was all that could be desired. He urged justice in dealings between
man and man and strict administration of trusts, care for the orphan
and widow and charity toward the poor. He condemned the use of intoxicating
liquor and gambling, saying: "They will ask thee concerning
wine and lots; answer, in both there is great sin, and also some
things of use unto men; but their sinfulness is greater than their use."
As to alms-giving the measure was to be, "what ye have to spare."</p>

<p>While plurality of wives was allowed&mdash;and Mahomet exercised the
privilege to the limit, furnishing a new revelation when necessary to
justify a new marriage&mdash;the virtue of the women is scrupulously
guarded by the Moslem code. The women are not allowed to mingle
with men, and this is one of the weaknesses of Mohammedanism. In
Mohammedan society the influence of women counts for little and
as a result the followers of Islam are sluggards in intellectual pursuits.
In the Philippines the Mohammedans form the lowest stratum of the
population; in Java they are just awakening to the necessity for education;
in India they are behind the Hindu and still farther behind
the Parsee; in Egypt they bring up the rear as they do also in Syria
and Palestine. Only where they have come into contact with Christian
civilization have they been stimulated to the discussion of schools and
questions of government.</p>

<p>It must be admitted, however, that some of the customs of Europe
and America have tended to prejudice the followers of Mahomet
against western civilization. One who was in attendance at a banquet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a><br /><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
given during the recent Morocco conference told me of the astonishment
of some of the Mohammedan representatives at what they saw.
When the ladies appeared in evening dress they, remembering the
veiled ladies of their own land, asked: "Do your women always dress
this way?" When wine was brought on, they asked: "Do all of your
people drink wine?" And when, after dinner, dancing began, they
asked: "Do the women dance with their own husbands only?" The
answers to some of these inquiries seemed to astonish them.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">TURKISH OFFICIALS</p></div>
</div>

<p>While Mohammedanism, as established by its founder, still holds
the allegiance of many scores of millions, influencing them for good
in many respects and for evil in some; while these orthodox followers
of the prophet kneel at stated hours each day and pray toward Mecca,
all of them, who have not done so, hoping to make the pilgrimage
commanded of them&mdash;while these are keeping the letter of the Koran
there is a reform at work which may yet leaven the whole lump.</p>

<p>Abbas Effendi, now a political prisoner at Akka, in Palestine, is the
head of the reform movement. He was born in Persia and is carrying
on the work to which his father and grandfather devoted their lives.
He discards force as a means of propagating truth, and while he does
not command monogamy, has set the example by having but one wife.
While Abbas Effendi's father preached moral suasion his followers
were charged with revolutionary designs and the family was exiled.
After remaining a time at Constantinople under the surveillance of
the sultan, the reform leaders were removed to Akka, a seaport not far
from Haifa. Here, surrounded by few followers, the son holds such
communication as he can with the rest of the church in Persia, his
doctrines having as yet taken but little root among the Turks and
Arabs. It is believed in Akka that he receives financial aid from a
number of wealthy Americans who have become interested in his
work.</p>

<p>We called upon Abbas Effendi as we were leaving Palestine and
found him an earnest old man with a careworn but kindly face. His
hair and beard are grey and he speaks with animation when his favorite
topic is under discussion. His doctrines are something like
those of Tolstoy, but he does not carry the doctrine of non-resistance
so far as does the Russian philosopher. How much he may be able
to do in the way of eliminating the objectionable features of Mohammedanism
no one can say, but it is a hopeful sign that there is among
the followers of Mahomet an organized effort to raise the plane of
discussion from brute force to an appeal to intelligence.</p>

<p>The government of the sultan is the worst on earth. It is more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
despotic than the Russian government ever was and adds corruption
to despotism. The czar has convoked a duma, the dowager empress
of China has sent her commissioners abroad with a view to establishing
a constitution, and even the khedive of Egypt has a council, but
the sultan still rules by his arbitrary will, taking life or granting
favor according to his pleasure. He lives in constant fear of assassination
and yet he does not seem to have learned that his own happiness,
as well as justice to the people, demands that the government
shall rest upon the will of the governed.</p>

<p>While in the sultan's realm, we learned something of the cruelty
practiced by his officials&mdash;let us hope without his knowledge&mdash;for while
he is responsible for the conduct of his appointees he may not know
all the evil done in his name. Not long ago a young student was
arrested and imprisoned because a paper was found in his house
which contained Gladstone's statement that the sultan was an assassin.
It was only a scrap of paper and had been given him because
the other side contained an advertisement for a hair restorer and he,
in taking the paper to his house, did not know of the offensive quotation.
Another young man was kept in prison until he died because
a book was found in his possession containing a picture of the sultan
under which some one, unknown to him, had written the word dog.
A third man was arrested because in ordering an engine he sent a telegram
containing the words: "Seventy revolutions." In his original
order he neglected to state the number of revolutions and sent the
telegram in answer to an inquiry. A fourth man was imprisoned
because he received a telegram inquiring about a burglary, the authorities
mistaking the word "burglary" for the word "Bulgaria,"
where the authorities were expecting an uprising. These instances&mdash;and
we heard of many more&mdash;are given simply to show that the citizen
of Turkey is in constant danger of imprisonment, however innocent
he may be of any intention to violate the law.</p>

<p>But it is in the realm of the censor that the most amusing cases
have occurred. The officials are destroying a great many books just
now in Turkey and are very careful about the introduction of new
ones. Recently the wife of a justice of the peace, frightened by the
confiscation of books in the houses of her neighbors, thought to avoid
all possible danger by burning her husband's library, but her hope
was vain for her husband was arrested as a dangerous character on the
ground that he must have had a library. As he was holding a judicial
position the fact that he no longer had books was a sufficient ground
for suspicion.</p>

<p>Religious publications are subjected to very strict censorship. Sunday<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
school lessons have been cut out because they quoted from the
Old Testament in regard to the killing of kings and the word "Christian"
is often added before sinners in order to make the text exclude
Mohammedans. A Sunday school lesson about Joash, the Boy King,
was objected to because the authorities did not think it proper to suggest
that a boy could be king. The above are actual cases, but they
have given rise to jokes that go a little farther. For instance, they say
that dynamos are not allowed in Turkey because the name sounds
like dynamite and that chemistries have been excluded because the
formula for water, "H<sub>2</sub>O," is suspected of meaning, "Hamud II is a
cypher."</p>

<p>I have had a little experience with a censor myself. At Beyrout,
one of the Turkish ports, a copy of the Koran and a copy of the Life
of Abbas Effendi were taken from me by the censor. I had no objection
to his holding them during my stay in the country, but when he
informed me that they would have to be sent to Constantinople I
demurred, and with the aid of our representative, Consul General
Bergholz, not only secured the books, but secured a promise that the
right of American citizens to carry books would not in the future be
interfered with at that port.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I desire to add that we ought to have an ambassador
instead of a minister at Constantinople. According to the custom
prevailing in the sultan's realm, a minister is not on equal footing
with ambassadors, and as other nations have ambassadors there American
interests suffer. We have eighteen cases now awaiting adjustment.
According to our law our appointment of an ambassador to
any country depends upon that country's willingness to send an ambassador
to us. This is a false basis. Our action should not depend
upon what other nations do, but upon our diplomatic needs, and we
need an ambassador at Constantinople whether Turkey needs one at
Washington or not. I understand that the question is already being
considered in congress, and from observation I am satisfied that the
time has come for the raising of our legation to the dignity of an embassy,
that American interests and the rights of American citizens may
have proper protection in Turkey, for nowhere is there greater need
for the introduction of American ideas.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>

<h3>HUNGARY AND HER NEIGHBORS.</h3>


<p>Southeastern Europe is out of the line of travel and little known
to us, if I can measure the knowledge of others by my own. In order
to learn something of this section we came northwest from Constantinople
through Bulgaria, Servia and Hungary. We passed through
European Turkey in the night, and morning found us in Bulgaria,
where nothing but an occasional minaret remained to remind us of
the Orient. Strange that so great a difference exists between two
populations separated for centuries by nothing but an imaginary line.
No more the Turk with his wealth of leisure, his baggy trousers and
his gay headgear, but the sturdy peasant working in the field with
his unveiled wife or trudging along the road carrying his produce to
market; no more begging for baksheesh by lame and halt and blind,
but a busy, industrious throng, each laboring apparently with a purpose
and a hope. All day long we rode past well cultivated
fields and tidy villages. The Bulgarians, judged by appearance,
might be thought a mixture of German and Italian, but they are
really Slavic in their origin. I had the good fortune to meet
a former minister, a very intelligent man with a good command of
English, and learned from him that there is a strong democratic
sentiment in that country and that the people are making constant
progress in the matter of education and political intelligence.</p>

<p>He said that during his ministry he had introduced into Bulgaria
the American homestead law and that it had resulted in an increase
in the number of peasant proprietors. It was gratifying to know
that American example had been helpful to people so remote from
us. He also spoke of the establishment in his country of state insurance
against hail, that being one of the greatest perils the farmer has
to meet. He said that the system had worked well. The railroads
and telegraph lines are also owned by the state in Bulgaria and are
operated very successfully.</p>

<p>The capital, Sofia, is a prosperous looking city, viewed from the railroad,
and has an elevation of some fifteen hundred feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span></p>

<p>We crossed the Balkan mountains and the second morning reached
Belgrade, the capital of Servia. The city has a fine location on a
bluff at the junction of the Save with the Danube. A day's visit here
gave an opportunity to see something of the population, as it was
Sunday and the streets and parks were filled with well-dressed, well-behaved
and intelligent looking people. The Servians, who are also
Slavic in origin, are members of the Greek Church, and at the
principal church of this denomination there was that day a large
congregation and an impressive service. King Peter, it will be
remembered, is the present ruler, having been called to the throne
three years ago when his predecessor was assassinated. The brutalities
attending the murder of King Alexander and his wife were widely
discussed at the time, the bodies of the king and queen being thrown
from the window of the palace into the park. While the new sovereign
was recognized by most of the powers of Europe, England refused to
send a representative to his court because the king retained some high
officials who participated in the assassination. As Servia has a parliament
which controls the ministry, and as this parliament was hostile
to the former king, King Peter was powerless to comply with the
conditions imposed by England&mdash;at least this was the explanation
given to me. I heard next day at Budapest, however, that some satisfactory
settlement had been reached and that England would soon
be represented at Belgrade. King Peter is not of humble ancestry,
as I had supposed, but is a grandson of a former king who was conspicuous
in the war for independence. Peter himself was in exile
in Switzerland at the time of his elevation to the throne, and having
during his residence there imbibed something of the spirit of constitutional
liberty, is much more popular than was his predecessor. There
is quite a close connection between Servia, Roumania, Bulgaria and
European Turkey, and it will not be surprising if the last remnant of
Turkish territory in Europe is, before many years, released from the
sultan's rule and a federation of Balkan states created. A majority
of the sultan's European subjects belong to different branches of the
Christian Church, and but for their quarrels among themselves they
would long before this have been able to imitate Servia and Bulgaria
in emancipating themselves.</p>

<p>The ride up the Danube valley from Belgrade to Budapest and
from Budapest to the Austrian boundary gives one a view of one of
the richest sections of Hungary. While the Danube hardly justifies
the poetic praise that has described its waters as blue, it is a majestic
stream, and its broad valley supports a large agricultural population.</p>

<p>No American can visit Hungary without having his sympathies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a><br /><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
enlisted in behalf of its people, for theirs is a fascinating history.
Their country is one of the most favored in Europe so far as nature's
blessings go. The Carpathian mountains which form a wall around
it on the north and east, shut out the cold winds and by turning back
the warmer winds from the south, give to Hungary a more temperate
climate than other European countries in the same latitude, and in few
countries has agriculture been more fostered by the state.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="budapest" id="budapest"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">A STREET IN BUDAPEST.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The present minister of agriculture, Dr. Ignatius Daramyi, has been
at the head of this department for ten years, and being an enthusiast
on the subject, he has introduced many new features and brought
his department into close contact with the people. During his administration
the annual appropriations for agriculture have increased
from about eight million dollars to about thirteen millions, and the
income from his department has risen from six million dollars to nine
millions, leaving the net cost to the state at present some four million
dollars per year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span></p>

<p>Hungary believes in furnishing technical training to those who
intend to farm; she had twenty-two industrial schools, with about six
hundred pupils, and these schools are so distributed as to make them
convenient for the small farmers. She has four secondary schools of
agriculture, with a total attendance of over five hundred, and to complete
her system she has an agricultural academy with a student body
of one hundred and fifty. In order to accommodate adults who have
not had the advantage of these schools, she has short winter terms
and traveling instructors. By systematic effort the agricultural department
is not only increasing the efficiency of the Hungarian as a tiller
of the soil, but it is increasing his general intelligence and raising the
standard of citizenship.</p>

<p>The experiment station is also a prominent feature of the work of
the department of agriculture. All new agricultural implements are
tested and reports are furnished upon their merits; there are several
seed-testing stations where farmers can secure at cost price, not only
selected seeds, but seed shown by experiment to be suited to the climate
and soil of their locality. Then there are a number of model farms
located at convenient points, which are intended to be object lessons
to the neighborhoods in which they are situated. At these model farms
and at other centers breeding establishments are conducted where
horses, cattle, hogs and sheep of the best breeds are kept and loaned
to the farmers about. These breeding farms have resulted in a marked
improvement in the quality and value of the stock.</p>

<p>Nor does the agricultural department confine its attention to stock
raising and ordinary farming; it is equally interested in horticulture,
vine dressing, forestry, and even bee culture. Government nurseries
furnish the hardiest varieties of young trees and vines and train those
who desire to give special attention to these branches of industry.
Instruction in the pruning of trees and the training of vines has an
artistic as well as a utilitarian side, and taste is developed in the
ornamentation of the arbors and gardens. Here, as elsewhere in
Europe, much attention is given to forestry, and under the direction
of the department of agriculture the work of preserving the old forests
and of planting new groves is being intelligently and systematically
done.</p>

<p>In addition to the work above outlined, the agricultural department
has taken in hand the matter of furnishing general information
to the farmers and farm laborers. It encourages the formation of
workingmen's clubs, co-operative societies and parochial relief funds.
It has established more than one thousand free libraries and publishes
a weekly paper with a circulation of about sixty thousand. More than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
half of the copies are published in the Hungarian language, the rest
being divided between five other languages, the Slavic coming next
to the Hungarian and the German following, although less than ten
per cent are printed in the latter language. To strengthen the ties
between employers and employés, harvest feasts have been inaugurated
and the attendance at these feasts is yearly increasing.</p>

<p>I have gone into detail somewhat in describing the scope of the
work undertaken by the agricultural department of Hungary because
I think that we might, with advantage, adopt some of its features.
Our national appropriation for agricultural purposes bears a small
proportion, not only to the amount of taxes paid by the farmer, but
to the appropriations made for other departments.</p>

<p>Budapest, the capital of Hungary, is one of the most attractive cities
in Europe. In 1896 I received a cablegram of congratulation from a
farmers' congress which was at that time in session in that city. I
remembered this because it was the only cablegram received from any
body of Europeans during the campaign.</p>

<p>Originally there were two cities, Buda on the south bank and Pesth
on the north bank, but they were united under one municipal government
some years ago, the names of the old towns being preserved in
the new. The foothills of the Alps extend to the very bank of the
Danube and furnish magnificent sites for villas, forts, public buildings
and the royal palace, while on the opposite bank there is a broad
plain, which affords ample room for the rapidly extending limits of the
commercial and manufacturing sections of the city. Several bridges
connect Buda and Pesth so that the river, while a great thoroughfare,
no longer divides the business and the official sections. The streets
of Budapest are wide, well paved, clean and lined with buildings quite
uniform in height, one of the avenues rivaling the Champs-Elysees in
Paris and Unter den Linden in Berlin; the parks are large and near
the city; the business blocks are imposing and the public buildings
models in design and construction. The parliament building, only
recently completed, is one of the handsomest in the world.</p>

<p>The Hungarian people are distinct in language and history from
all their neighbors. In fact, the Hungarians differ in many respects
from all the other people of Europe, the inhabitants of Finland being
their nearest kinspeople. Their early history is unknown, but they
came from western Asia where the Mongolians, the Turks and the
Finn-Ugrians struggled for mastery about the beginning of the Christian
era. They were first known as Huns and claim Attila as one of
their race. They have more often, however, used the word Magyars
to describe their people, that name being a popular one at present.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a><br /><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
Their occupation of the present territory dates from about the ninth
century, since which time they have figured prominently in the history
of Europe. About the beginning of the eleventh century Hungary,
under the leadership of King Stephen (later known as St. Stephen)
became a Christian nation, and since that time she has been conspicuous
in all the religious wars of Europe. In the fifteenth century she
furnished the leader of the Christian army in the person of John
Hunyadi, one of the greatest military geniuses of that period. His
prominence in war brought his son Matthias to the throne of Hungary,
a king who, when warned of a plot against his life, exclaimed: "Let
no king, ruling justly and lawfully, fear the poison and assassin's
dagger of his subjects."</p>

<p>As early as the thirteenth century, Hungary began to inaugurate
political reforms, and in 1222 her nobility ended a struggle of a
hundred years by securing a concession which is regarded by her
people as equal in importance to England's Magna Charta of 1215.
It was in the form of a royal letter, issued by Andrew II. and called
the Golden Bull, owing to the fact that the seal attached to it by a
silk string rests in a box of gold. This document contained certain
promises to the nobles and admitted the binding force of certain
restrictions upon the king. The Golden Bull was the beginning of
constitutional government in Hungary, and while it has not always
been strictly observed by her rulers, it has served as a basis for subsequent
negotiations. For several centuries they elected their kings.</p>

<p>During the nearly seven hundred years which have elapsed since
1222 Hungary has had a checkered career. Rival aspirants for the
throne have fought over the succession and been aided in their ambition
by neighboring nations; kings and nobles have fought over their
respective authority; the nobility and the peasants have fought over
their rights; different branches of the Christian Church have been at
war with each other, for Hungary has been the eastern outpost of
Protestantism as well as a champion of Christianity; and more recently
Hungary has been fighting for her political independence. Hers has
been a long drawn-out struggle in which her people, time and again,
have almost been exterminated, but she emerges from it all a strong,
vigorous and militant nation. She is now a part of the Austro-Hungarian
empire, and her people form the largest homogeneous group in
the empire: When we consider the numerous wars between Austria
and Hungary, the difference in race, history and language, and the
dissimilarity in political training, it is not strange that there should
be lack of harmony between the empire as a whole and its largest
single member.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span></p>

<p>When Hungary turned to Austria for help against the Turks and
came under the Hapsburg line, she insisted upon a recognition of
her national rights and
secured a promise that
her people should have
control of their own
affairs. While this alliance
did not save her
from the Mohammedans,
it united her destiny
to that of Austria,
but she has never surrendered
her independence.
The crown of
Hungary has always
been distinct from that
of Austria, and the emperor
of Austro-Hungary
must visit Budapest
and receive with
the crown of St. Stephen
the title of king
of Hungary. Joseph
II., son of the beloved
Maria Theresa, was the
first king to refuse to
receive the crown and
swear fidelity to the
Hungarian constitution,
and the Hungarians would never call him their "crowned king"
until, on his deathbed, he retracted his arbitrary measures and permitted
the restoration of the constitution.</p>

</div>

<p>In her struggle for liberty Hungary has developed many patriots,
among whom Louis Kossuth is the best known. He and Francis Deak
were the leaders of the revolution of 1848 which resulted in the constitution
of that year. The constitution of 1867 was not quite so liberal,
and these two constitutions form the basis of the present political
division in Hungary; all Hungarians are jealous of the rights of their
nation but the majority of the members of parliament insist upon the
recognition of the constitution of 1848.</p>

<p>The elder Kossuth lived in exile after the revolution of 1867 and
was during his exile enthusiastically received in the United States<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
by congress and by the people in general. Kossuth's son is now a
member of the coalition ministry, and at a banquet to which I had
the good fortune to be invited, spoke feelingly of the treatment which
his father received in the United States and of the high regard felt
by Hungarians for
America and Americans.
Count Apponyi,
the foremost orator of
Hungary, also paid his
respects to the United
States and likened our
country to the forwarding
station in wireless
telegraphy, saying that
the political current
was so strong in our
country that its messages
were carried to all
the world.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">COUNT APPONYI</p></div>
</div>

<p>I happened to be in
Budapest at the opening
of parliament and
heard the speech of the
new premier, Dr. Wekerle.
The independence
party has a large
majority in the parliament,
having shown
increasing strength at
each successive election.
The emperor, Francis
Joseph, is resisting one of the demands made by the Hungarians, viz.,
that the army shall use the Hungarian language instead of the German
language. Some years ago the fight was made and won for the use
of the Hungarian language in schools, in the courts and in parliament,
and the Hungarians feel that their nationality is endangered by the
fact that their army is taught only the German words of command.
The emperor takes the position that the use of the Hungarian language
would destroy the unity of the imperial army. To prevent a rupture
he proposed the formation of a coalition cabinet, to hold until the
suffrage could be extended and the question again submitted to the
people. There is no doubt that the people are practically unanimous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
in favor of their own language and that an extension of the suffrage
will not change the complexion of parliament. The relations between
the emperor and
Hungary have become
very much
strained, and the
aversion to the German
language is so
pronounced that
Hungarians who can
speak the German
language will often
refuse to answer a
question addressed to
them in German.
For Francis Joseph
himself the Hungarians
have a strong
affection, and they
would be glad to contribute
to the happiness
of his closing
days, but they feel
that the interests of
their nation are vitally
concerned and
they are anxious to
have the point at issue
settled before a
new sovereign ascends the throne. If the emperor were left to himself,
he would probably conclude that a Hungarian fighting force, attached
to the empire and grateful for consideration shown their country,
would form a more effective part of a joint army, even though the
Hungarians spoke their own language, than troops compelled to learn
a language hateful to them. History furnishes many examples of
successful armies made of corps, divisions and regiments speaking
different languages, but less numerous are the instances of nations
successfully held together by force when one part of the empire was
made subservient to the interests of another part. Hungary is being
alienated by insistence upon requirements which do not in reality
strengthen the empire, while she might be drawn closer to the throne
by a more liberal policy. The end is not yet.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI.</h2>

<h3>AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.</h3>


<p>Reference has already been made to the attitude of Hungary, in the
article on Hungary and Her Neighbors, toward Austria, and what is
true of Hungary is to a less extent true of Bohemia and the Polish
section of the empire. In fact, Austria-Hungary is held together by a
rope of sand, and there is no telling when that rope may break. It
required the aid of Russia to hold Hungary within the empire a half
century ago, and now that Russia is no longer in position to bolster
up the Hapsburg house, the outlook is not bright for the family of
Francis Joseph, unless the friendship of Emperor William takes the
form of armed assistance. I mention this because the anti-Austrian
feeling in Hungary, the anti-Hungarian feeling in Austria, the aversion
to the German language in Bohemia, and the demands of the Polish
subjects, not to speak of disaffection elsewhere, all point to trouble
ahead for the ruler of Austria-Hungary. I visited Bohemia with a
view to gathering information on the situation and was surprised to
find the hostility between the German and Bohemian elements. A
half century ago the German language was spoken everywhere in
Bohemia, but to-day the Germans and Bohemians have separate schools
and, except where business interest compels it neither learns the language
of the other. So strong is the feeling that a Bohemian, desiring
to master the German language, would, if financially able, study it outside
of Bohemia in preference to attending a German school in his
own country.</p>

<p>It is a great misfortune to the people of Hungary and Bohemia, as
well as to the imperial government, that this hostility to the German
language has become so bitter, for the German is one of the great languages
of the earth, being the spoken tongue of more than fifty millions
and containing in printed form most of the literary treasures of the
world. The German libraries are rich in treatises on science and art,
history and philosophy, government and religion, and these should be
within reach of the people of Hungary and Bohemia. Whatever may be
the merits of the Magyar and the Czech languages, they are spoken by
so few, comparatively, that they can not possibly furnish so large a
store of learning as the German language contains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span></p>

<p>The Austrian government, however, has itself to blame for the
estrangement; for, instead of attempting to win the affections of the
alien people made subject to it, it attempted to coerce them, with the
usual result. Resentment toward the rulers soon turned into resentment
toward the language, and it became patriotic to abhor a tongue
which it would have been advantageous to cultivate. Human nature
is the same everywhere, but kings seem to be as ignorant of it as they
are of the lessons of history.</p>

<p>The Austria-Hungary empire can not exist long under its present
regime; if it is to continue, the bond of union must be a substantial
one and no bond of union is substantial that does not knit itself about
the hearts of both parties to the union. There are certain advantages
to be derived from the association of several small states together, but
these advantages can not be weighed against fundamental rights or
against a strong national sentiment. Cold, calculating statesmen sometimes
underestimate the influence of sentiment, but they usually discover
their error, sometimes too late, if they attempt to trample upon it.
Austria-Hungary as a federation of states, each absolutely independent
in its internal affairs, would be strong, but Austria-Hungary,
composed of dissatisfied groups, all yielding unwillingly to an arrogant
Austrian influence, is pitiably weak.</p>

<p>The tie which holds Canada, Australia and New Zealand to England
is infinitely stronger than that which binds Hungary and Bohemia to
the Austria-Hungarian throne. And why? Not because they use
the same language, for the American colonies wrote the Declaration
of Independence in the same tongue that George III. employed.
Canada, Australia and New Zealand are loyal to England because
England allows them to do as they please. If a British parliament
acted toward these colonies as the imperial government acts toward
Hungary and Bohemia, even a common language and a common
history could not prevent a separation. "There is a scattering that
increaseth," says Solomon, "and a withholding of more than is meet,
but it tendeth to penury." The proverb can be applied to governments,
and Francis Joseph might consider it with profit.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that Bohemia is no insignificant part of
the empire. It has an area of twenty thousand square miles and a
population of more than six millions, and is rich in minerals and in
manufactures. It is noted for glass works, Bohemian glass having
a world-wide reputation. It has important textile industries also, and
its agriculture has been carried to a high state of perfection. It has
played a conspicuous part in the history of central Europe, is rich
in heroes and possesses a strong national spirit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span></p>

<p>Prague, its capital city, has long been an educational center and is
still the seat of its intellectual as well as its political life. There is a
very complete industrial school at the capital, which contributes in
no small degree to the country's prominence in manufacturing. Just
now Bohemia is the Mecca for violinists, America contributing her
quota of students.</p>

<p>John Huss's church is still one of Prague's landmarks, although
the Catholic Church has regained its supremacy. The Hradschin and
the public buildings surrounding the Hradschiner Platz are of historic
interest, as is also the old Jewish burying ground.</p>

<p>Our American consul at Prague, Mr. Ledoux, has inaugurated a
very praiseworthy index system for the collection and preservation of
information of value to importers and exporters. He has converted
one room of the consular office into a reading room where American
trade papers are kept for the business public and where a list of American
exporters with a description of their wares may be examined by
those desiring to purchase. It is an application of the public library
system to trade and struck me as likely to be of value in increasing
our sales.</p>

<p>Carlsbad is only a few hours ride from Prague, and I took advantage
of that fact to visit it. It is built along the narrow and winding
valley of the Tepl and is nearly twelve hundred feet above the sea.
It has been a health resort for some six or seven centuries and is now
visited yearly by more than fifty thousand invalids. The water is hot,
and the numerous springs seem to come from a common reservoir.
The principal spring, called the Sprudel, has a temperature of one
hundred and sixty-four degrees and contains sulphate of soda, carbonate
of soda and common salt. The solid substances deposited by the
water soon form into a very hard rock which takes a polish like marble.
These deposits gather so rapidly that all pipes leading from the springs,
and the springs themselves, must be frequently cleaned or they would
soon be choked up.</p>

<p>Liver complaint is the disease which brings most visitors to Carlsbad,
and I was surprised to find that, instead of being a fashionable resort,
a majority of the patrons are of the middle classes. It is a city of
boarding houses and small hotels with a few larger establishments.
By eleven o'clock <small>P. M.</small>, the streets are deserted and the town asleep,
probably because the early morning is the time for drinking the water.
I rose at five and with our vice consul at Prague, Mr. Weissburger, as
my guide, hurried to the springs; the invalids were even then beginning
to come forth, each with his mug, and soon there was a swarm
of them. The city has erected large pavilions at several of the springs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a><br /><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
and at two of these bands play between six and eight. By 6:30 the
streets were crowded and the pavilions jammed. The numerous
attendants were kept busy filling the mugs (which are put into long
handled holders) from the gushing fountains. At the time of the
Lisbon earthquake the largest spring is said to have ceased its flow for
three days.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">CARLSBAD</p></div>
</div>

<p>Riding through Bohemia at this time of the year, one sees a great
deal of fine farming land, the only unpleasant feature being the number
of women at work in the fields and along the roads. The more
one sees of the world, the more he can appreciate the remark of the
witty Frenchman, Max O'Rell, who, in his lecture on "Her Royal
Highness, Woman," declares that if he were going to be born one of
that sex, he would pray to be born in America. Woman's position
in our country is not only vastly superior to her position in Asia, but
very much better than the position of the average woman in continental
Europe.</p>

<p>Vienna is not only the capital of the Austria-Hungarian empire,
but is one of the greatest cities of Europe. It is worth visiting for its
architecture alone, its public buildings combining massiveness and
grace. It is also rich in monuments and statuary and well supplied
with drives, parks and places of amusement. The boulevards are
lined with restaurants, each with a large yard filled with tables and
chairs, the refreshments being served in the open air during the summer
months. These places are thronged in the evening and on Sunday
afternoon, families often bringing their lunch baskets and buying
their coffee or beer at the restaurant.</p>

<p>The coffee houses, as they are found in Vienna, deserve mention.
These are scattered all over the city and are very popular. Newspapers
are usually kept on file and the customers read the events of
the day while they sip their coffee or beer.</p>

<p>Vienna is a musical center, and its theaters are not surpassed anywhere.
We attended a production of Faust there, a French opera
built upon Goethe's great drama, and found the theater constructed
with a special view to the accommodation of a large orchestra. Nor
is it strange that music should be so distinguishing a feature of
Viennese life when it is remembered that it was the home of Strauss,
of Haydn, of Mozart, of Shubert and of Beethoven, not to speak of a
number of lesser lights.</p>

<p>Vienna is also famous for its educational institutions. Its university
has an honorable record of more than five centuries, and its
medical college is attended by students from every land.</p>

<p>Vienna is also an example in the matter of municipal ownership,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
it having gone beyond all the other cities on the continent in the
taking over of what are known as the natural monopolies. It finds
it not only possible to own and operate its water works, lighting
plants and tramways, but it finds it profitable to do so; the profits
which, under private ownership, go to the stockholders, accruing in
Vienna to the whole people. So successful is municipal ownership
in practice that opposition to the principle has been silenced. Those
who, in the United States, are struggling in spite of the influence of
organized wealth, exerted through subsidized newspapers, corrupted
councils and sometimes even through a biased judiciary, to restore
the streets of our cities to the public, can find encouragement in
Vienna's experience. The conflict can have but one end, namely,
triumph for municipal ownership. "Sorrow may endure for a night,
but joy cometh in the morning."</p>

<p>Austria-Hungary has a well developed system of forestry; I noticed
this on a former visit and made inquiries about it this time. There
is a law compelling the planting of a tree whenever one is cut down,
and not content with maintaining the present number, the denuded
hills are being replanted. It seems difficult to turn public attention
to any subject until some abuse has made action imperative, but the
sooner our country awakes to the danger involved in the destruction
of our timber, the less we shall be compelled to suffer for the
enormous waste committed in our forests.</p>

<p>I have been intending for some time to speak of the matter of
permanent buildings for our embassies, and Vienna is a case in point.
Our ambassador at Vienna, Mr. Francis, has had difficulty in finding
a suitable place for the embassy. I discussed the subject during my
former visit abroad, and my observations on this trip have still further
strengthened the opinion that our country owes it to itself, as well as
its representatives, to purchase or erect at each of the foreign capitals
a permanent embassy building. At present each new ambassador
or minister must begin his official career with a house-hunting expedition,
and the local landlords, knowing this, are quick to take
advantage of the situation. At one place an American ambassador
was recently asked to pay double what his predecessor had paid, and
as he was not willing to do this, he is still living at a hotel. There
are not many suitable buildings from which to select, and our representative
is at the mercy of those who control the limited supply.
Diplomatic requirements are such that the embassy must be centrally
located and sufficiently commodious to enable the ambassador or minister
to return the courtesies which he receives. Small apartments
are numerous, and there are a few palaces which can be rented, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
the former are not large enough and the latter much larger than
necessary. Our government ought to own a building conveniently
located and suitable for the offices and home of the ambassador. It
must either do this or choose between two systems, both of which
are bad, viz., compel the representative to spend more than his salary
for house rent, or continually increase the salary of diplomatic representatives
to keep pace with the growing rent in the capitals of the
world. To throw the burden upon the government's representative
is undemocratic; to risk constantly increasing rent is false economy.
It is not in harmony with our theory of government to have an
important branch of the public service open to rich men only, and
that is the case under the present system. No poor man can afford
to accept an appointment as an American minister or ambassador to
any of the principal countries of Europe, and as the years go by, the
expense of a diplomatic residence will become greater as the value
of urban property increases. While the telegraph and the cable have
considerably decreased the responsibility of the foreign representative,
by bringing him into closer contact with the home government, still
much depends upon the ability, the sagacity and the discretion of
those whom we send abroad. Our government ought to be in a position
to select from the whole citizen body those most competent for
the work to be entrusted to them, and it goes without saying that
efficiency in the public service is not measured by the amount of
money which an official has either inherited or accumulated.</p>

<p>There is another argument in favor of the building of permanent
embassy buildings which ought to have weight with our people. If
diplomatic representatives are chosen only from those who are able
to spend more than their official incomes, it naturally follows that
some will be richer than others and that the establishments maintained
will differ in expensiveness. In fact, experience has shown
that a new representative is sometimes embarrassed by the lavish
expenditures of a preceding one. The standing of our nation abroad
demands that our ambassadors and ministers shall live in a style
in keeping with our ideas, and extravagance is as offensive as parsimony.
By owning its own embassy buildings our government can
regulate the standard of living and entertainment of those who represent
it at foreign courts. There is no doubt that our nation must
ultimately come to this plan, and the sooner it adopts it, the better.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII.</h2>

<h3>THE DUMA.</h3>


<p>There is at least one man in Russia who has reason to feel that his
political judgment has been vindicated and his predictions verified
by the assembling of the duma. It is Count Ignatieff, who, at the
age of twenty-eight, framed the Pekin treaty and who, as minister
of the interior (the highest cabinet position at that time), in 1881
formulated a plan for a national assembly. His scheme was to have
three thousand representatives elected by the people, these representatives,
gathered from all parts of the empire, to meet at Moscow and
confer with the emperor in person in regard to legislative measures.
In order to avoid the objections raised to so large an assembly, he
proposed to divide the body into groups of one hundred each, these
groups to meet separately. He secured the approval of the emperor,
but the other members of the cabinet were so strenuous in their opposition
that the emperor decided not to attempt the reform and Count
Ignatieff resigned from the ministry. He warned his associates that
a failure to recognize the demands of the people for representation
in the government would simply delay the change and that it was
better to yield before the demands became more radical, but the
members of the bureaucracy, deaf to the appeals of the people and
blind to their own interests, resisted, and as a result a duma is now
in session at St. Petersburg, the bureaucracy finds itself an object of
contempt and loathing, and the present emperor, like his predecessor,
has to bear the sins of his advisers.</p>

<p>I called upon Count Ignatieff and found him still vigorous in spite
of his grey hairs and advancing years. I was interested in him not
only because he is friendly toward our country and speaks our language
fluently, but more especially because he was a pioneer in a
great movement and foresaw what many of the nobility even now
fail to recognize, viz., that there is no place where arbitrary power
can justify its existence. The tide of progress has swept past the
Count, and he is now classed among the conservatives, but he deserves
to be remembered because he had the courage to speak out when it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
required bravery to propose the taking of a step in the direction of
popular government.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 250px;"><a name="iggy" id="iggy"></a>
<img src="images/ill189.jpg" width="250" height="335" alt="iggy" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">COUNT IGNATIEFF.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The duma is the result of the labors of hundreds, yes, thousands
of Russian reformers, a few conspicuous, but the most of them
unknown to fame, who for more than seventy-five years have been
insisting upon constitutional government. It is one of the most
remarkable bodies of men ever convened in a national capital, and
I have been abundantly repaid for coming here. The duma must be
seen to be appreciated;
even more, to
understand it one
must not only see the
members, but must
know something of
the struggle through
which they have
passed. I am satisfied
that the czar
himself is more liberal
than his advisers
and that, left to
himself, he would
long ago have made
concessions which
would have brought
the throne and the
subjects nearer together,
but he has
yielded so slowly and
given so grudgingly
that the people have
become very much
estranged. To illustrate
this I need only
cite the facts, first
as to the election. St. Petersburg and Moscow are the political centers
where the officials and the nobility have the strongest representation,
and yet in the elections the constitutional democrats won an overwhelming
victory in both these cities. In St. Petersburg the ticket
which represented the emperor received only two thousand votes out
of a total vote of sixty thousand, and in his home precinct, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
three hundred voters were sent to the polls in court carriages, his ticket
received only eighty votes! Could anything more clearly prove the
frail hold of the government upon the people? And it must be remembered
that they do not have universal suffrage in the cities, but
a property qualification which excludes the poorest of the people, the
very ones who have most reason to desire popular government.</p>

<p>The second proof of the feeling against the government is to be
found in the unanimity with which the duma opposes the position
taken by the government's minister. While the members of the
duma are divided among themselves on many questions, they act as
one man in their opposition to the government's policy, insofar as that
policy has been outlined. In fact, the tension has been so great that
I was afraid the body might be dissolved by imperial order before
we could reach St. Petersburg.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 448px;"><a name="duma" id="duma"></a>
<img src="images/ill190.jpg" width="448" height="237" alt="duma" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE PALACE WHERE THE RUSSIAN DUMA MEETS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The sessions of the duma are held in a palace built by Catherine
the Great for one of her favorites, General Potemkin. It is a commodious
building and has been remodeled to meet present needs. The
largest room, extending the entire width of the building, was once
the ballroom and some notable entertainments have been given in it&mdash;entertainments
calling for a lavish expenditure and attended only
by the nobility; now the room serves as a lobby, and peasant representatives,
wearing the usual blouse and top boots, stride through
it as they go to and from the sessions. In another part of the building
there are ample dining rooms where the members of the duma and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
the press may secure meals at very moderate rates. The assembly
hall is large enough to accommodate the four hundred and fifty members,
but is badly lighted. The windows are all back of the speaker's
platform, so that the members sit with their faces towards the light.
It would be much better if the light came from above, but it is really
surprising that the accommodations are as satisfactory as they are,
considering the short time the workmen had to make the necessary
changes.</p>

<p>Back of the president is a life-sized painting of the czar in uniform;
on the left is a box occupied by the ministers when present, and beyond
the ministers is a still larger enclosure occupied by the representatives
of the foreign press. To the right of the president are seats for members
of the council of empire who may be in attendance, and
beyond them the enclosure occupied by representatives of the Russian
press. Just in front and a little below the president's desk is the
rostrum from which the members of the duma address the assembly,
and just below this rostrum is the reporters' table where the stenographers
take down the proceedings. Besides the rooms already mentioned
there are committee rooms, cloak rooms, rooms for the home
press and for the foreign press, etc., etc. In a word, the duma building
looks very much like an American legislative hall or a European
parliament building&mdash;a likeness still further emphasized by the presence
of men and women clerks, doorkeepers, pages and spectators. One
thing only was out of harmony with a legislative body, and that was
a company of soldiers stationed in a wing of the building as if in
anticipation of possible trouble. We were present at two sessions of
the duma and found them intensely interesting. The morning session
is at present given up to speeches on the land question, more than a
third of the members having expressed a desire to be heard on this
subject. The speeches are usually short and often read from manuscript.
Hand-clapping is allowed, and there was always applause at
the close of the speeches. Occasionally the president announced that
some speaker on the list surrendered his time and this statement also
brought forth applause, the discussion of the subject having by this
time become tiresome.</p>

<p>By the courtesy of our ambassador, Mr. Meyer, we were admitted to
the diplomatic gallery, from which we could survey the entire body.
There is probably no assembly like it on either hemisphere. It is
made up of all classes and represents every shade of opinion. There
are members of the nobility who have cast in their lot with the people,
lawyers who have temporarily left their practice to devote themselves
to the larger interests of the public, professors fresh from the universities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
business men from the cities, laboring men from the factories,
and there are, most numerous still, peasants from the farms. Some of
the members are near the end of life and command attention by their
years as well as by their words, and there is a sprinkling of young men
who have become the spokesmen of their communities, but the majority
are middle-aged men who have years of experience behind them, and
are yet strong for the battle. In garb there is also great variety, the
black frock coat, the business suit, the belted blouse, and the clerical
robe are all to be seen. The smooth face seems to be at a discount in
Russia; one would suppose, so plentiful are whiskers, that the barbers
were on a strike. There are many heavy heads of hair, too, sometimes
the locks falling to the shoulders, sometimes cut square about the ears.</p>

<p>The lobby is a better place than the gallery to study features; sitting
on one of the visitors' seats in this commodious hall we watched the
members passing to and fro and were introduced to a number of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
by the American newspaper men who are reporting the proceedings
for the press of our country. There are also a number of Americans
here studying the Russian situation as a preparation for university
work at home, a son of the late Dr. Harper of Chicago being one of
these. I shall send with this article a number of photographs of the
more prominent members, but I regret that I cannot bring before my
readers some of the faces
that we observed in the
lobby, faces which seemed
to present an epitome
of Russian history&mdash;strong,
firm, unyielding
faces which plainly tell of
the stern resolve that lies
behind the peasant movement.
They may protest,
like Mark Antony, that
they have neither "wit nor
words nor worth, action,
nor utterance nor the power
of speech to stir men's
blood," but they can "put
a tongue in every wound"
of their countrymen that
will almost "move the
stones to rise and mutiny."</p>

</div>

<p>This is the first duma,
and it has not proceeded
far enough to fully develop
the permanent leaders,
but, if I may use the
simile, as the basket of pebbles is shaken by debate, the large ones are
gradually rising to the top. The president of the duma is Prof. Serge
Murmetseff, of Moscow, whose learning and judicial temperament combined
to make him the choice of the several parties, no one of which
can claim a majority. The constitutional democrats have the largest
membership and are the best organized. They also have the advantage
of occupying the middle ground between the radicals and the
conservatives. Having about one hundred and fifty members on their
rolls and some thirty more acting with them, they can count upon
enough votes from the more conservative elements to defeat the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
extreme radicals, and they can rely upon enough radical votes to
carry out their program. The floor leader of this party is Vladimir
D. Nabokoff, of St. Petersburg, a member of a prominent family and
himself until recently an instructor in the national law school. He
is about thirty-eight years of age, intelligent and alert, and has the
confidence of his party. The orator of the constitutional democrats is
Theodore I. Rodicheff, a scholarly looking man of fifty. He is polished
in manner and persuasive in speech. One of the most influential of
the constitutional democrats is Mr. Maxim Winawer, a Jewish lawyer of
the capital. He is sometimes described as the "brains" of the party
and is credited with drafting the duma's reply to the address from the
throne. He is one of the ablest civil lawyers in the empire and his
election from St. Petersburg, where there are but three thousand Jewish
voters, out of a total vote of sixty thousand, and his elevation to the
vice-presidency of the national organization of his party, would seem
to answer the charge that there is widespread hostility to the Jews
among the people.</p>

<p>Nabokoff, Rodicheff and Winawer are members of the duma and are,
therefore, prominently before the public at this time, but in popularity
they have a rival in the person of Paul I. Miliukoff, editor of the
"Retch." (The government would probably put a "W" before the
"R" and give the word its English meaning, but in Russian the word
Retch means speech.) Mr. Miliukoff, it will be remembered, was one
of the candidates of his party in St. Petersburg, but the government
compelled the substitution of another name because he was awaiting
trial for an alleged violation of the press laws. He was acquitted
soon afterward and is one of the moving spirits in the present parliamentary
struggle. He speaks excellent English and has lectured in
the United States. No one need despair of reform in Russia while
such a man as Miliukoff devotes his great ability to journalism.</p>

<p>Next to the constitutional democrats, the members of the "group
of toil" form the largest party. There are about a hundred of these,
and Alexis G. Aladin is their leader. He is even younger than Nabokoff,
but has already shown himself to be a man of force and originality.</p>

<p>Count Heyden is the leader of the conservative element, if there is
a conservative element in the duma. Perhaps it would be more accurate
to describe him as the spokesman for the least radical group, for
all the members of the duma are reformers, differing only as to the
extent of the changes and the speed with which they shall be made.
He was once considered radical, but he has not moved as rapidly as
public sentiment. Count Heyden bears quite a resemblance to Uncle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
Sam as he is pictured in the newspapers. I have spoken somewhat at
length of the leaders in order to show that while the grievances of the
peasants and laborers are at the bottom of the movement, all classes
are enlisted in the effort to establish constitutional government.</p>

<p>The afternoon sessions are generally lively, for it is at this time
that the ministers make their reports, offer their measures and answer
the questions propounded by the members. The session which we
attended was no exception to the rule. The house was full, the galleries
crowded and the newspapers fully represented. There were more than
forty Russian writers in their corner and not less than fifty of the
foreign press in theirs. When the representative of the war department,
replying to a question concerning some recent military executions,
declared that the minister of war was powerless to overrule the generals,
there were shouts of "Murderer!" "Assassin!" "Dog!" and other
equally uncomplimentary epithets.</p>

<p>One of the demands made by the duma is for the abolition of the
death penalty. This might seem a very radical measure to us, but
the conditions are quite different in Russia. Here there is no assurance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
of an impartial trial, and torture is resorted to to force an admission
of guilt. Only recently three persons were found to be innocent after
they had been tortured and put to death. The members of the duma
feel that the only security to the people is in the entire abolition of
the death penalty, for while those who are falsely accused still live,
there is a chance to rescue them. In this respect exile, hateful as it is,
has its advantages; I met a member of the duma who was returned
from exile by the government upon the demand of the duma. In the
torturing of prisoners for the purpose of extorting a confession Russia
is even behind China, bad as China is, for in the latter nation it has
been abolished, except where one is charged with murder, and is only
permitted then after the guilt of the accused has been established by
other evidence.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">MEMBERS OF THE RUSSIAN DUMA.</p></div>
</div>

<p>There are a number of important measures which are very little
discussed in the duma because they are certain to receive the approval
of the government; one of these provides for universal education. The
program of the duma also includes legislation guaranteeing freedom of
speech, freedom of the press, protection for the Jews and local self-government
for the Polish portion of Russia. As the women have
taken an active part in the agitation for constitutional reform, all of
the parties are committed to woman's suffrage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span></p>

<p>Just now the land question is paramount. About one-third of the
entire acreage of land in the empire is in the hands of the czar, the
government and the nobility, and the peasants demand that it shall be
turned over to them. At this time they are willing to have compensation
made to the owners, but the more they think about it and the
more vehement their demand becomes, the less they are likely to consider
compensation. There
is no doubt that there are
enough cases of injustice
and contemptuous indifference
to their needs to
arouse resentment among
the peasants, if we take
human nature as we find
it. They tell of instances
where whole villages have
been compelled to pay toll,
generation after generation,
for the privilege of
crossing some nobleman's
land to reach the land
farmed in common by the
people of the village. Powerless
to condemn land
for roads, as it can be done
in other countries, they
have grown more embittered
year by year until
some of them feel that
patience has ceased to be
a virtue. It is now intimated that the government will offer a partial
distribution of land as a compromise.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">MAXIM WINAWER.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The opponents of expropriation seek shelter behind the excuse that
the peasants attack the principle of private ownership. While it is
true that there are socialists in the duma who prefer communal holdings
to private ownership, the object of the peasants is not to dispossess
small holders, but simply to give the peasants access to the large
estates. The situation resembles, in some respects, the situation in
Ireland, except that in Russia the land is to be turned over to the
communities. I made some inquiry regarding the question of joint
ownership and learned from one of the best informed men in Russia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a><br /><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
that there is a growing sentiment in favor of individual ownership.
Ownership in common does not give to each individual that stimulus
to improve his land, which is the important element in individual
ownership. In riding through a country one can distinguish with
considerable accuracy between the farms cultivated by their owners
and those cultivated by tenants, because the tenants, as a rule, are
unwilling to make permanent improvements. One Russian economist
estimates the income from the owned lands of Russia at thirty per
cent above the income of the same area of communal lands. He
attributes it to the ability of the land owners to supply themselves
with proper tools and to furnish or borrow at low rates the money
needed for cultivation, but it is possible that this difference may be
in part due to the fact that ownership makes the incentive to labor
greater, and offers a richer reward to superior effort.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">GROUP OF RUSSIAN DUMA WITH MR. BRYAN IN CENTER</p></div>
</div>

<p>There is an upper house, or council of empire as it is called, which
shares the legislative power with the duma, but it does not receive
much attention because its composition is such that it cannot reflect
public sentiment, and cannot oppose the will of the people except at
the risk of its existence. Half of the members of this council are
appointed by the emperor and the other half elected by different
interests. The nobility elect some, the universities some and the
zemstows some.</p>

<p>The duma does not recognize the council of empire as a co-ordinate
branch of the government and will not be slow to express itself in
favor of a radical change in the method of selecting the members of
this upper house, or even its abolition, if it stands in the way of measures
which have a large majority in the duma.</p>

<p>What will be the outcome in Russia? A Russian would hardly
venture a prediction, and for an outsider, prophecy is even more hazardous.
The situation could scarcely be more complicated. Generations
of misrule have brought an accumulation of questions, all
pressing for solution. The duma wants a great many things done and
wants them done at once, while the government, if it remains under
the influences of the bureaucracy, will give as little as possible. So
far, the government has been unfortunate in that it has delayed making
concessions until still greater concessions were demanded. The
program of the present ministry has been so completely repudiated
that the emperor may find it easier to appoint a new ministry than
to humiliate the present one by compelling it to propose what it has
heretofore refused. If a new ministry is formed and the duma is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
consulted about its personnel, Ivan Petrunkevich will probably be the
premier. He is a member of the duma and the head of the parliamentary
organization of the constitutional democrats. He has already
proposed a constitution to Nicholas II. If the duma is disregarded
and a ministry formed from the emperor's present advisers, it will at
least be more liberal than the one now in office.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 250px;"><a name="ivan" id="ivan"></a>
<img src="images/ill197.jpg" width="250" height="347" alt="ivan" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">IVAN PETRUNKEVICH.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The duma is a permanent
institution; it
could not be abolished
by imperial decree
without endangering
the crown itself, and it
cannot be dissolved or
prorogued with safety.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
The government must,
therefore, treat with the
duma and agree with
such compromises as
may be necessary to
maintain peace between
the executive and the
people. The officials,
too, are learning from
the duma something
about the science of
government. When
there was no one to
speak for the people,
the czar could claim to
voice their sentiments.
He can claim this no
longer. When the people were denied a hearing, the officials
could deny that the people desired reforms, but the officials cannot
put their unsupported opinions against a unanimous duma. The
elections have shown how insignificant a support the government has
among its subjects, and these figures contain a warning, which even
the bureaucracy cannot entirely disregard. Does the government rely
upon the army? The soldiers are drawn from the people and serve
for three years, a half million raw recruits being enlisted each year.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
Is it possible that they can be different in sentiment from their fathers
and brothers? In three years the Russian army will be made up of
men in hearty accord with those who speak through the duma. Without
an army to rely upon, what answer can the bureaucracy make to
the legislature?</p>

<p>The czar has already suffered much at the hands of his advisers;
he is no longer the idol he was, and reverence for the Church has
abated somewhat, as reverence for him, its temporal head, has decreased.
What can he do? There is but one course open to him. He asked
the people what they wanted and they have told him. As he cannot
doubt that they have told him the truth, he must either accept their
answer or confess that he does not intend to consider their wishes. If
he would appoint a new ministry, propose a measure guaranteeing
freedom of speech and freedom of the press, recommend an agricultural
bank to protect the peasants from the small money lenders, recall the
exiles, release political prisoners and invite the leaders of the duma to
confer with the ministry in regard to the land question, he would be
restored to the affection of his subjects and have no reason to fear
bomb-throwers or hostile criticism. He would find a hundred and
thirty millions of loyal subjects a much stronger bodyguard than a
few hired soldiers. His position is a difficult one because his environment
is unfriendly to the masses, but having burned the bridges
behind him, he must go forward.</p>

<p>Russia is not decaying. She has extent of territory, abundant
natural resources and an immense population. To be sure, a majority
of her people were serfs until a generation ago, but there is no race
distinction between the nobility and the peasant, and with education
the extremes of society are being drawn closer together. That
Russia has a great future is not open to doubt. What experiences
she may pass through before she emerges a free, self-governing
and prosperous nation no one is wise enough to foresee, but the people
who have sacrificed as much for liberty as have the Russian patriots
have in them the material of which mighty nations are made. The
duma is ready to do its part; will the government rise to the occasion?
Time alone can tell.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</h2>

<h3>AROUND THE BALTIC.</h3>


<p>The discussion of the duma occupied so much space that I was
compelled to omit from that article all mention of Russia in general,
and to St. Petersburg in particular; I shall therefore begin this
article with a brief reference to the Moscovite empire. Two and a
half years ago, when I saw Russia for the first time, I entered by the
way of Warsaw and went to St. Petersburg from Moscow. While
considerable territory was covered, the winter's snows made the whole
country look barren and uninviting. This time our course lay
through the Baltic provinces, and as farming was at its height, the
country presented a much fairer picture. The cities and villages
through which we passed were busy with life and each had its church,
for the Russians are a church-going people.</p>

<p>St. Petersburg is a fascinating city. The Church of St. Isaacs,
with its great granite monoliths on the outside, its pillars within
covered with malachite and lapsus lazuli, and its immense bronze
doors, is among the world's most imposing places of worship; the
equestrian statue of Peter the Great is famous, and the art gallery is
of rare merit. Russia's bronzes are most excellent, and her stores
exhibit a large assortment of furs.</p>

<p>In St. Petersburg I found myself, as on my former visit, admiring
the horses, they being, upon the whole, the best that I have seen since
leaving America. Possibly the fact that so many stallions are driven
singly and in pairs may account, in part, for the handsome and
stylish animals seen upon the streets, but certain it is that the Russian
horse is a splendid representative of his breed. There is a large park,
called the Point, near the city, and in the evening this park and the
approaches to it are thronged with carriages and droskies. As the
sun does not set there at this season of the year until between nine
and ten and is followed by a long twilight, the drives are gay with
life until midnight. We did not reach our hotel until eleven o'clock,
although we were among the first to leave the park.</p>

<p>Speaking of horses, reminds me that the Russian coachman has an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
individuality all his own. His headgear is peculiar, being a squatty
beaver with a spool-shaped crown, but one soon forgets the hat in
contemplation of the form. The skirt of the coachman's coat is very
full and pleated, and the more stylish the equipage, the broader is
the driver. Beginning at the shoulders, his padding gradually increases
until about the hips he is as broad as the box upon which he sits.
This padding is carried to such an extreme that the coachman sometimes
has to be lifted upon the box, and it is needless to say that he
is practically helpless, as well as useless, in case of an accident. It
may be that this style of dress is designed for a wind break for those
who are seated behind the wearer&mdash;this was one of the explanations
given&mdash;or it may be that it, like some other fashions in wearing apparel,
has no foundation in reason.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="stock" id="stock"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">A VIEW OF STOCKHOLM.</p></div>
</div>

<p>I found to my disappointment that Tolstoy is not contributing
materially to the political revolution that is taking place in Russia.
Being revered throughout the land not only because of his philosophy,
but also because of his fearless arraignment of the despotism that
has afflicted Russia, he might be a powerful factor in giving direction
to the popular movement, but believing that individual regeneration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
furnishes the only complete emancipation from all forms of evil, he
takes but little interest in what he regards as the smaller and less
important remedies proposed by the duma. It remains to be seen
whether it is wiser to secure that which is now within reach, and
then press forward for other advantages, or to reject piecemeal reforms
in the hope of ultimately gaining larger ones. Probably the pioneer
in thought and the practical reformer will never be able to fully
agree upon this point.</p>

<p>The boat ride from St. Petersburg to Stockholm is one of unsurpassed
beauty. It requires about thirty hours to make the trip, and
of that time but two hours are spent in the open sea, the remainder
of the route being between islands that fill the Baltic and the Gulf
of Finland as the stars stud the sky. Just out of St. Petersburg is
Russia's most important naval station, where we saw a number of
warships and were informed that the crew of one of them had
recently refused to comply with a sailing order, answering that it was
waiting to see what the duma would do.</p>

<p>Until about a hundred years ago Finland was a part of the Baltic
Empire, of which Sweden was the head, and of the three million
inhabitants of Finland, something like twenty per cent are of Swedish
descent. As might be expected, the Swedish element was not only the
official element, enjoying to a large extent the titles of nobility, but
it is still the wealthier and more influential portion. The Finns
proper are not Laplanders, as their northern position would suggest,
neither are they in race closely akin to the Slavic or Scandinavian
population. As mentioned in the article on Hungary, they came
from western Asia and are quite distinct in race characteristics from
their present neighbors. They acquired from their Swedish conquerors
a fondness for the public school, and the percentage of illiteracy
is much less in Finland than in other parts of Russia, under
whose dominion they unwillingly came in 1808.</p>

<p>Our boat stopped at Helsingfors for a few hours, and we had an
opportunity to visit the principal points of interest in the capital of
Finland. It is a substantial and prosperous looking city with large
school houses, attractive public buildings and commodious churches.
We passed several small parks where children were playing and
where numerous comfortable seats beckoned the weary to rest beneath
the shade. I confess to a partiality for the small city park; it is
much better to have these breathing spaces so scattered about through
densely populated sections that the children, as well as the adults,
can find in them a daily refuge than to have the entire park fund
lavished upon suburban parks, which can only be visited occasionally.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
It is a pity that space is not more often reserved for these parks in
the laying out of towns, for the ground not only becomes more valuable
in proportion as these small parks are the more needed, but the
opening of them in the heart of a city brings a large unearned increment
to those who own land adjacent to them.</p>

<p>We could not help noticing the contrast between the market of
Helsingfors and those which we visited in Asia. At the former
neatly dressed peasants, men and women, exposed for sale from the
end of their carts a
bountiful supply of
vegetables, meats, butter,
eggs and cheese.
The eggs were stamped
with the name of the
owner and the date of
laying, the butter was
packed in wooden
buckets of various sizes,
and the cheese was of
many varieties. Some
of the carts were filled
with stacks of black
bread baked in large
flat cakes. The radishes
presented a temptation
that I was not
able to withstand; the
fondness for them, restrained
during the
months of travel
through the Orient,
overcame me, and at
the risk of being
thought extravagant, I
purchased five dozen at a gross outlay of about five cents and lived high
until they were all gone.</p>

</div>

<p>The Finns are rejoicing over the autonomy recently secured, and
they have signalized their partial independence by creating a single
parliamentary body whose representatives are elected by the entire
population, male and female, above the age of twenty-four. No one
can understand the persistency with which the Finns have struggled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
for constitutional government without recalling that, as a part of
Sweden, their country long enjoyed the right to representation in the
nation's councils. The people have always resented Russian methods,
and only a few years ago the governor general sent from St. Petersburg
was assassinated by a young Finn who, having thus given expression
to his nation's hatred of despotism, immediately took his own
life. The death of the governor was followed by the suspension of
such few privileges as the people had been enjoying, but when last
year the whole of Russia seemed about to rise in rebellion, the czar
announced his willingness to grant all that was asked, and now one
can travel through Finland without being harassed by soldiers or
bothered about passports.</p>

<p>If Constantinople can claim to be the natural capital of the eastern
hemisphere, Stockholm can with equal justice claim to be its
natural summer resort. It is situated at a point where a chain of
lakes pours its flood into the Baltic, so that the citizens of Sweden's
capital have their choice between the fresh water and the salt. As
the lakes and the sea are filled with innumerable islands, each family
can have one for itself. Summer homes are probably more numerous
near Stockholm, in proportion to the population, than anywhere
else, because during the winter months the people live in flats. One
is immediately struck with the compactness of the city and with the
absence of single dwellings surrounded by yards. Owing to the severe
cold and the long, dark days of winter, the people huddle together
in great blocks and thus economize fuel, and they are at the same
time close to their work. As soon as spring opens there is a general
movement toward the islands, and as we approached Stockholm from
the Baltic and left it through the lakes, we saw a great many summer
cottages and watched the boats carrying their cargoes of passengers to
and fro.</p>

<p>Sweden's lakes are so numerous and so large that about eight per
cent of her entire area is given up to these internal waterways, and
they probably account for the fact that her people had a large domestic
commerce before the era of railroads. These lakes are so situated
that by connecting them by canals water transit has been secured
between Stockholm on the east coast and Gothenburg on the west.
The boat trip through these lakes and canals is one of the most
pleasant to be found in Europe.</p>

<p>The Swedes who have come to the United States are such excellent
farmers that I was surprised to find but twelve per cent of the area
of Sweden devoted to agriculture and fifty-one per cent described as
woodland. Only fifty-five per cent of the population is now engaged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
in farming, the proportion having fallen from seventy-two per cent
since 1870, while the proportion engaged in other industries has
risen from fifteen to twenty-seven per cent.</p>

<p>Lumbering, fishing and shipping each gives employment to a large
number of men, and iron mining, long a leading industry, is still
important, although, owing to the development of mines elsewhere,
Sweden now furnishes but one per cent of the entire output of ore
as against ten per cent in the eighteenth century. The fact that
she had such an abundant supply of the raw material early gave her a
conspicuous place in iron manufactures, and the familiarity with
this metal may be due to the fact that Sweden was quick to take
advantage of the railroad, the telegraph and the telephone. In electrical
appliances she now claims a second place among the nations.
A large use has also been made of the water power with which the
country abounds, notably at Norrkoping, where an industrial exposition
is now in progress.</p>

<p>We spent a day at this exposition for the purpose of gathering
information in regard to industrial Sweden. While the agricultural
display was not ready, the exhibit of the products of the factory was
exceedingly interesting. The articles shown included metal work of
all kinds and varieties, from heavy machinery to parlor ornaments.
In one section canned fruit was displayed, in another great rolls of
linoleum and oilcloth, and in still another textile fabrics. The cloth
was especially worthy of notice, being of superior quality and of
every color. There was also a complete assortment of dairy implements
and farm tools. So skillful is the Swedish artisan that the
International Harvester Company has recently established a branch
factory at Norrkoping, and with the aid of American foremen is
preparing to manufacture reapers and mowers there, not only for
Sweden but for northern Europe.</p>

<p>In addition to the machine-made exhibits, there were specimens of
the handwork of peasants and students. These included many varieties
of needlework, wood carving, and decoration on leather and bark.
Peasant girls in native costume presided over these displays and gave
the visitor a glimpse of the picturesque garb now fast disappearing
before the prosaic dress of the cities. At Skansen, in the suburbs
of Stockholm, and at a few of the enterprising stores, this quaint
costume may still be seen, but it is not generally worn now even in
the country.</p>

<p>There is a gallery at Norrkoping exposition where one may see
a collection of Swedish and Danish art, the pictures not only portraying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
the familiar features and flaxen hair of the north, but recalling
the long nights and the winter scenes of that latitude.</p>

<p>Sweden was a pioneer in the matter of universal education and has
at Upsala a state university founded in 1477&mdash;fifteen years before
Columbus sailed for America. She has also had a college of medicine
for more than a hundred years, and her sons have taken high
rank in all the departments of science. Her grammar schools run
back to the time of Gustavus Adolphus, and her common school
system is almost as old. She has given to the world among other
things the Sloyd system of teaching, which combines manual training
with mental instruction. Sweden has shown by her prominence in
literature, science, art and music that the higher altitudes do not chill
the imagination or repress genius, and yet, the country is even more
noted for the high average of intelligence among the people than for
the extraordinary accomplishments of a few.</p>

<p>The Swedish language contains so many words that resemble the
English that the Swedish newspaper looks much more familiar than
the Greek or the Russian, but it is not always safe to rely upon the
similarity in spelling. For instance, "rum" means room, and when
it appears in a window or on a door, it is only an innocent announcement
that travelers can find accommodation within. The word
"bad" means bath, and "bad rum," therefore, is a familiar sign in
hotels.</p>

<p>Sweden has her political problems like all the other nations, and
just now her people are absorbed in the question of extending the
suffrage. The upper house is an aristocratic body composed of representatives
of the wealthier classes. In electing members to this
body a rich man's vote counts for more than a poor man's vote, it
being possible for the richest person to have about ten times as many
votes as the poorest. As might be expected, the upper house is conservative
and stands in the way of some of the reforms proposed by
the more popular branch. The last ministry was a liberal one, but
resigned when the upper house defeated the measure for the extension
of the suffrage. The new ministry has at its head Mr. Lindmann,
a business man who represents the commercial and conservative elements,
and his party is willing to accept an extension of the franchise,
provided it is coupled with minority representation, the aim
being to increase the conservative strength in the lower house in
order to protect the upper house from attack. The conservatives
fear&mdash;and not without reason&mdash;that an overwhelming liberal majority
in the popular branch would soon endanger the aristocratic character,
if not the very existence of the upper house. The situation is interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
in that it indicates the growth of radicalism in the country.
The conservatives recognize this and are prepared to make concessions;
they hope to retard the progress of the movement but realize
that they cannot defeat it entirely.</p>

<p>Industrial questions are receiving consideration in Sweden; laws
concerning child labor have been enacted, accident insurance has
been provided, and an old age pension is being discussed. Attention
is also being given to the housing problem in the cities, to farm allotments
and to the establishment of labor bureaus and boards of arbitration.
The Gothenburg license system is in operation in Sweden,
under which the sale of liquor, where the sale is not entirely prohibited,
is in the hands of semi-official corporations. Whether this
system is responsible for it or not may be open to question, but
statistics show that there has been a large decrease in the sale of
beverages containing a high percentage of alcohol.</p>

<p>By the courtesy of the American minister, Colonel Graves, I had
an opportunity to pay my respects to King Oscar II. I was glad to do
so for two reasons: First, because so many of his former subjects
have become American citizens; and, second, because of the honorable
part which he played in the recent crisis which resulted in the separation
of Sweden and Norway. He is of powerful frame, and though
seventy-seven years old, would pass for a much younger man. He
has a kindly face and rides about the city without a guard. A more
ambitious monarch would have met Norway's demand with armed
resistance, but he, recognizing that the holding of Norway against
the will of the people would involve his country in perpetual strife,
advocated a peaceful separation, provided the people of Norway asked
for it in unmistakable terms.</p>

<p>For thirty years he had been the sovereign of both, and in his old
age he could not bear to see the two countries engaged in a bloody
conflict. He is just now criticised by some who did not become
sanguinary until all prospect of war was past, but he has the consolation
of knowing that his critics are not only alive but have no
dead relatives to mourn. Had he plunged his country into war, his
critics could remind him of vacant chairs at the fireside.</p>

<p>King Oscar has, in a most practical way, proved himself to be a
promoter of peace and as such deserves the prize provided by that
great Swedish chemist, Alfred Nobel. By giving conspicuous approval
to his course, the trustees of the Nobel fund may be able to encourage
other sovereigns to imitate him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIX.</h2>

<h3>DEMOCRATIC NORWAY&mdash;HER SUN, HER SCENERY
AND HER CORONATION.</h3>


<p>Norway was so full of attractions at the time of our visit that I am at a
loss to know in what order to treat of them. As those things which are
permanent will interest a larger number than the transient ceremonies
attending the crowning of a new king, I shall give the preference to the
most distinguishing feature of Norway, that which has been interwoven
with her name, viz., the midnight sun. Owing to its accessibility and to
the fact that its climate is moderated by the influence of the Gulf stream,
the coast of upper Norway furnishes the best opportunity which Europeans
have to mount the Arctic merry-go-round and view the sun
through the whole nightless day. It is a weird experience, this passing
from day to day without intervening darkness, and one returns from it
somewhat exhausted, for the light tempts him to encroach upon the
hours of sleep.</p>

<p>The North Cape, the northernmost point of the continent of Europe,
is usually the destination of the tourist, but it is not necessary to go so
far to see all that there is worth seeing. There are several towns above the
Arctic circle where for several weeks the sun never sinks to the horizon.
At Bodo, which is but little more than a day's ride by boat from Trondhjem,
the sun is visible at midnight from May 30 to July 11. At Hammerfest,
which is the terminus of some of the steamboat lines and which
claims to be the northernmost town in the world, the sun does not set
between May 13 and July 28, while at Tromso, not quite so far north
as Hammerfest, the inhabitants have but ten days less of the midnight
sun.</p>

<p>We stopped at Svolvaer, one of the chief fishing stations of the Lofoden
Islands, nearly two hundred miles north of the Arctic circle. We
arrived about seven in the evening, and would have seen the sun the
previous night but for a bank of clouds behind which it passed at about
11:30. Svolvaer nestles at the foot of some snow-crowned peaks which
shut out the northern horizon, and it is necessary to go out into the
open sea or to climb a mountain to get an uninterrupted view. With
our usual good luck we found an English-speaking Norwegian who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
studied in the United States, and with him to direct us, we spent a memorable
night among the islands.</p>

<p>The channel to the north, known as Raftsund, is one of the most picturesque
along the entire coast, and the Troldfjord which leads from
it through a rockbound gorge to the outlet of a famous mountain lake,
is not surpassed in rugged grandeur. Troldfjord deserves to be described
by a poet, for prose can not do it justice. If any of my readers have
ever passed through the Royal Gorge in southern Colorado, they may
understand me when I say that Troldfjord is a Royal Gorge with its
walls widened to a quarter of a mile and lengthened to a mile, and
the space between them filled with a transparent sea, whose surface perfectly
mirrors every rock and shrub. At the upper end of the fjord
is a majestic cascade, the dashing, splashing, foaming outlet of the
lake two hundred feet above. Our launch ceased its throbbing and
sat swanlike on the fathomless water, while we feasted our eyes upon
a picture so beautiful that darkness hesitates to draw a curtain over
its charms.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="viking" id="viking"></a>
<img src="images/ill200.jpg" width="450" height="317" alt="viking" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE VIKING SHIP AT CHRISTIANIA.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The mountain, Digermulkollen, selected as an observation point, is
on the Raftsund and not far from the Troldfjord. I can not give its
height, but when I guessed at it before the ascent, I put it at five or six
hundred feet; after ascending it I am satisfied that it is a thousand.
We timed our trip so as to reach the top at midnight, slaking our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
thirst from the snowbanks along the trail, and it was the fault of the
clouds that we did not see the orb of day&mdash;at this season and in this latitude
he is orb of the night as well&mdash;as he reached the lowest point; but
they were kind to us a little later, for through a rift in them we saw
the face of old Sol just long enough to be sure that he, like ourselves,
was up for all night. Even though the clouds concealed the sun at the
witching hour of midnight, the light was the light of day, and I had
no difficulty in reading a paper (which truth, as well as loyalty to
my own publication, compels me to say was The Commoner). The
fact that we almost missed seeing the sun at all leads me to remark
that many make the entire trip without catching a glimpse of it. We
were informed that an excursion steamer had gone to the North Cape
and back in mist and rain just a few days before. It had not occurred
to us in planning our visit to Norway that cloudy weather had to be
taken into consideration, but we found that clear nights are the exception
rather than the rule, especially during the latter part of the season.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="hjor" id="hjor"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">IN HJORENDFIORD.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Svolvaer is a quiet place in summer, but during January, February
and March its little harbor is full of fishing smacks, for thirty thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
men fish in the waters of the Lofoden Islands. Cod is the principal fish
taken and codliver oil is one of the chief products of the islands. Immense
quantities of dried fish are shipped to southern Europe, while the
fresh and salted fish find a market in the British Isles and Germany.</p>

<p>If one desires to see merely fjords, glaciers, lakes and mountain
streams, the southern part of Norway offers a sufficient variety of each.
Bergen, the principal city on the west coast, the second city in the country
and a former member of the Hanseatic League, is the seaport of this
northern Switzerland. With the Sogne Fjord on the north, Hardanger
Fjord on the south and west and a chain of lakes almost connecting the
two, one can see every variety of scenery in a three days' trip around
Bergen. As we had but two days to spend there, we had to miss the
northern fjord, but Hardanger, the twenty-one mile ride across the
mountains and the railroad from Voss back to Bergen, furnished such a
wealth of scenery that another day could hardly have added much to our
enjoyment.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="trol" id="trol"></a>
<img src="images/ill202.jpg" width="450" height="334" alt="trol" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">TROLDFJORD.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Taking a boat at Bergen, we devoted eleven hours to winding about
through Hardanger Fjord, and every moment presented some new attraction.
These fjords seem to have been formed by a convulsion that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
opened great cracks in the mountains which line the coast of Norway.
In some places the shores are precipitous cliffs, reaching from the water
upwards for hundreds of feet, but for most of the way the banks slope
back and are covered with stunted pines and undergrowth. Scattered
all along the way are innumerable cascades and waterfalls, varying in
width from a few inches to many feet. At one place we counted eleven
of these in sight at one time, and we were never out of hearing of their
music. Some of them are harnessed to little sawmills. At one point the
boat halted within a few hundred yards of a great glacier, which is
crawling down a mountain gorge, and from whose mouth, as from a
fountain, gushes a ceaseless stream. For ages this mass of ice has been
slowly moving down from the mountains, and every day tons upon
tons melt and disappear, but its losses at its base are made good at its
top, and it lives on like the human race, ever dying and yet ever young.</p>

<p>Disembarking at Eide we took a four-hours carriage ride, following a
mountain stream to its source, crossing the range at an elevation of a
thousand feet and descending along another stream to the lake upon
which the village of Voss is situated. From this point a scenic railroad,
which passes through fifty-two tunnels in seventy miles, took us back to
Bergen. As might be gathered from what has already been said, Norway
does not impress the tourist as a farmer's paradise, although agriculture
is first among her industries. The farms, as seen from the routes of travel,
seem very diminutive and are usually triangular in form and look
like wedges inserted in the cracks of the mountains. Occasionally a valley
is broad enough to invite the cultivation of a level piece of land and
the invitation was long ago accepted. Potatoes grow well in Norway and
are of excellent flavor. On the coast boats they furnished the staple, and
sometimes almost the only, vegetable, although the bill of fare often included
seven different kinds of fish, nearly as many varieties of cold
meat, half as many brands of cheese, besides white, brown and black
bread. Rye, barley and wheat are grown in the southern districts and
grass everywhere. Owing to the frequent showers and the long days of
summer, grass grows very rapidly, but as it is difficult to cure it, the
people have adopted a plan which looks peculiar to foreigners. They
build frames that look like sections of a fence and the green hay is hung
upon the boards or wire as the case may be. The lower rows are protected
from the rain by the upper one, and the air has access to all of it.</p>

<p>About three hours' drive from Bergen there is a little wooded island
on which the great Norwegian violinist, Ole Bull, built a summer home
where he was wont to retire at the conclusion of his tours and where at
last he died. He was not only a great admirer of American institutions
and of the American people in general, but he married an American,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
and his daughter returns to Norway every year to celebrate May 17,
Norway's independence day, at her father's home and with her father's
countrymen. The daughter is one of the many connecting links between
the two countries, and by her invitation, extended through our
consul, Mr. Cunningham, we had the privilege of visiting this historic
spot. We were glad to do so, because Ole Bull was not only one of the
great musicians of the last century, but he was one of the greatest democrats
that Norway has produced&mdash;a democrat not in a partisan sense,
but in that broader sense in which it describes one who believes in the
people, trusts them and labors for their welfare.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="oldbull" id="oldbull"></a>
<img src="images/ill203.jpg" width="450" height="559" alt="oldbull" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">OLE BULL.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span></p>

<p>There are many public men in Norway worthy of mention, but space
forbids an enumeration of them. There is, however, a relic of great historic
interest to which I must devote a line. It is the Viking Ship, a
thousand years old, now on exhibition at Christiania. It was dug up
twenty-five years ago and is fairly well preserved. It gives one an idea
of the ships used by those early seamen of the north whose daring
exploits make fiction seem tame.</p>

<p>It so happened that we arrived in Norway just in time to attend the
coronation of King Haakon VII., and we had our first opportunity to
see royalty on parade. The new king is a son of the king of Denmark,
and his wife, Queen Maud, is daughter of the king of England. When,
last year, Norway withdrew from her union with Sweden, the crown
was offered to a son of King Oscar, but the offer was refused, and it is
probably not too much to say that the Norwegians expected it to be refused,
but they wanted to show that separation was not due to antagonism
to the reigning house. It was then tendered to the son of King
Frederick and accepted. I shall speak later of the circumstances which
explain this selection; it is sufficient at present to say that the new king
is a sober, earnest, sensible looking young man of about thirty-five and
seems to have made a very favorable impression upon the Norwegian
people. By the courtesy of Minister Graves, who represents our country
at Stockholm, and who, our minister to Norway not having received his
appointment in time, was our nation's special ambassador to attend the
coronation, we received invitations to the coronation ceremonies and
were presented at court. While the newspaper reports of the coronation
may rob what I am about to say of some of its freshness as news, I shall
venture to describe what we saw, begging the reader's indulgence if I
betray a lack of familiarity with the technical phrases employed on
such occasions.</p>

<p>The coronation took place at Trondhjem, the former capital, a city
situated on one of the numerous fjords that indent the western coast.
The building selected for the occasion was the Gothic cathedral, the
largest in Scandinavia, which was commenced in the eleventh, and completed
in the fourteenth century. It is a historic building and belonged
to the Bishopric of which Ireland was a part before America was discovered
by Columbus. The cathedral has suffered from several fires, and
a part of it was in ruins for three centuries. It is now sufficiently restored
to furnish a larger audience room than is to be found in most
cities of the size. Under the dome a circular space was left for the royal
party while the visitors were seated, the foreign representatives nearest
the center, on raised seats in the nave and transepts. A broad aisle was
left, extending from the entrance through the center to the chapel at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
the other end. Just before time for the king to arrive, a company of
white-robed Lutheran priests marched from the chapel to the door, and
a stalwart body of men they were. They marched back at the head of
the procession, the king following, his crimson, ermine-lined robe trailing
many feet behind&mdash;or it would have trailed but for the fact that it
was carried by four attendants. The king was accompanied by several
officers and followed by the standard bearer holding aloft the royal
banner. Then came the queen wearing a robe similar to the king's, but
it only required three attendants to keep its folds from the floor. She
was attended by three maids of honor. The king and queen were escorted
to thrones on opposite sides of the aisle, and the representatives
of royal families occupied seats next to them. The Prince of Wales sat
nearest the queen, next to him Prince Henry of Germany, and the
American ambassador next. Near the king sat Denmark's representative,
then Russia's, and next to him the representative from France.
There was gold braid galore; some of the foreign representatives had
enough on their clothes to put the Sultan of Sulu to shame. I never
before saw so much gold, and I have been wondering since whether
there may not be a new yellow peril of which our financiers have little
dreamed. Our representatives used less of this ornamentation (they all
wore military uniforms) than those of any other country, and the question
arises, what is going to become of the honest dollar if, with the
spread of the ideas of a republic, the amount of gold braid is decreased
and a vast quantity of gold is poured through the mints into the volume
of the world's currency? It might so enlarge the volume of money as
to make the money changers clamor for the demonetization of gold,
and, then the silverites would be called gold bugs for insisting upon
the free and unlimited coinage of gold.</p>

<p>After some excellent music, instrumental and vocal, a member of the
clergy ascended a pulpit not far from the king and queen and delivered
an earnest address. He was a typical Norwegian, powerful of frame and
strong of face&mdash;such as we might imagine one of the Viking chiefs to
have been. Then there was more music, and it may interest the readers
to know that all the music was prepared for the occasion, the words of
the cantata being by the pastor of the church, and the hymns being
written in the language of the peasants. Finally the king arose, proceeded
down the aisle to the chapel and kneeling, received from the
bishop the insignia of office, the crown being placed upon his head, a
gold chain about his neck, a sceptre in one hand and a golden globe in
the other. As soon as he returned to the throne, the queen advanced to
the chapel and was likewise invested, and then the premier, Mr. Michelson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
proposed a salute to the king and queen. The people responded
with earnestness and the exercises were concluded.</p>

<p>I do not expect to witness another coronation, and it will be some
satisfaction to remember that the first and only one attended was that
of a king whom the people of their own accord selected; for if there is
anything more democratic than a republican form of government, it is
the fundamental principle that the people have a right to have whatever
form of government they desire. Jefferson emphasized this doctrine
when the people of France called Napoleon to the throne, and it has
Bible sanction as well, for when the children of Israel still demanded a
king, even after Samuel explained what a king would do, he was told
to let them have their way.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="maud" id="maud"></a>
<img src="images/ill204.jpg" width="450" height="296" alt="maud" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">KING HAAKON AND QUEEN MAUD.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The next day we put on our best clothes and joined the line that
passed before the king and queen. It was not a very satisfying
experience, but it is worth something to know how such things are done,
and I may add, the more an American sees of it, the more he appreciates
the simplicity of public life in his own country.</p>

<p>Norway, in spite of the choosing of a king, is the most democratic
country in northern Europe. She has no nobility, confers no titles and
had to go outside of her own realm to find one of royal birth. She had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
her kings and princes in the early days, but one Norwegian statesman
explained to us that when they lost their privileges they emigrated to
America and went to farming. The choice of a Dane was not strange,
if a king was to be chosen from without, for Norway was united with
Denmark for more than three centuries, and there has always been a
friendly feeling between the two countries. It was expedient, too, under
the circumstances, to offer the crown to the son of the Danish king, for
this brought Norway's throne into kinship with the thrones of England
and Russia, as well as with that of Denmark. In fact, the circumstances
and the situation had a good deal to do with the four-to-one vote in
favor of a monarchy. When it is remembered that Norway's paramount
aim was to secure independence and that this might have been jeopardized
by an attempt to establish a republic at the same time, it is really
surprising that one-fifth of the people had the courage to vote to plant
a republic amid surrounding monarchies. There are many in Norway
who prefer a president to a king and who object to having two and a
half millions of people taxed nearly two hundred thousand dollars a
year to pay the salary of a kingly figurehead, but the monarchists reply
that the king's position is purely ornamental and enables the government
to maintain cordial relations with other European countries while
the people govern themselves through the storthing. They point out that
the king has much less power than our president. While this is true,
they forget that a president elected by the people and holding office but
four years can be trusted with more executive authority than an hereditary
monarch. The storthing has absolute power, and as its members
are elected by universal suffrage every three years, and as there is but
the one parliamentary body, public sentiment finds prompt expression
in the government. It can be truthfully said, therefore, that with the
exception of the executive branch of the government, Norway is thoroughly
democratic and that the influence of the king is reduced to a
minimum.</p>

<p>Norway has a promising future. Her people are hardy and intelligent.
Education has been compulsory for fifty years, and it is the country's
boast that it spends more per capita on schools than any other
country in Europe. Because of Norway's immense shipping interests,
she demanded a separate consular service, and this was one of the
causes of friction between her government and the government of
Sweden. Norway has a great future, and much is to be expected of
her people. Her sons and daughters, those who have emigrated to
America, as well as those who have remained at home, prove to the
world that it is possible for a people to acquire the refinements of civilization
without losing their original strength and vigor.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XL.</h2>

<h3>ENGLAND'S NEW LIBERAL GOVERNMENT.</h3>


<p>Great Britain has recently experienced one of the greatest political
revolutions she has ever known. The conservative party, with Mr. Balfour,
one of the ablest of modern scholars, at its head, and with Mr. Joseph
Chamberlain, a powerful orator and a forceful political leader, as
its most conspicuous champion, had won a sweeping victory after the
Boer war, and this victory, following a long lease of power, led the Conservatives
to believe themselves invincible. They assumed, as parties
made confident by success often do, that they are indispensable to the
nation and paid but little attention to the warnings and threats of the
Liberals. One mistake after another, however, alienated the voters and
the special elections two years ago began to show a falling off in the
Conservative strength, and when the general election was held last fall
the Liberals rolled up a majority of something like two hundred in
the House of Commons. A new ministry was formed from among the
ablest men of the party&mdash;a ministry of radical and progressive men
seldom equaled in moral purpose and intellectual strength. My main
object in visiting London at this time was to become acquainted with
the personnel of the new government and learn of their program.</p>

<p>Before speaking of the ministers, just a word in regard to the king,
who is the head of the government whether it be liberal or conservative.
The government of Great Britain is always in harmony with the House
of Commons, and as the ministers speak for the king, he does not emphasize
the virtue of consistency, for he may be put in the attitude of
advocating a thing to-day and opposing it to-morrow. He is not expected
to have opinions upon public questions or, if he has them, they are
always presented with the understanding that if the ministers will not
adopt his views he will adopt theirs. It is much easier to be a king now
than it used to be and the burdens of a monarchy have been very much
lightened in the nations which, like England, recognize the omnipotence
of parliament.</p>

<p>I was very glad to avail myself of the opportunity offered by a private
audience to meet his majesty, King Edward, and to be assured of his
personal interest in the promotion of peace. The king has a very genial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
face and makes the visitor feel at ease at once. He has a knowledge of
world politics and, by his tact and good nature, has done much to promote
cordial relations between his own and other countries. It may not
be out of place to correct an impression that has gone abroad with regard
to the style of dress required of those who are admitted to the presence
of the king. Because knee breeches are worn at court functions many
have understood, and I among them, that they were required on all
occasions; but this is not the case. Most of the calls made upon him informally
are made before lunch and the ordinary black coat is worn.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
The requirements are not as strict as they are in Russia, Japan and
Sweden, where I was advised to wear an evening suit for a morning call.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 347px;"><a name="vii" id="vii"></a>
<img src="images/ill205.jpg" width="347" height="539" alt="vii" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">KING EDWARD VII.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, a sturdy Scotchman, is the new
prime minister, and those who know him intimately feel that his selection
is a vindication of the doctrine that patience and courage, when
joined with merit, are invincible. He is now well advanced in years and
during his entire public career has stood unflinchingly for democratic
ideas. He has not been discouraged by the fact that he has often been
in the minority; on the contrary, he has felt as confident in his position
when he has had to maintain it amid taunts and jeers as when his
speeches brought forth applause. He is not as great an orator as Gladstone,
but he has a very persuasive manner and his fine sense of humor
gives brilliancy to his speeches.</p>

<p>In outlining the policy of the Liberal party last December, he credited
the victory at the polls to several causes&mdash;the tariff question, the
Chinese question, the educational problem and municipal questions.
He pledged his party to certain reforms and boldly advocated a reduction
of military and naval expenses. He pointed out that there could
be no retrenchment in taxation if the appropriations for armaments
and for armies continued to increase. He has been called a "little Englander,"
but that did not deter him from uttering a protest against
rivalry in the building of warships.</p>

<p>In view of his utterances in favor of arbitration and against militarism
it was most appropriate that he should deliver the address of welcome
at the recent session of the Interparliamentary Union, better
known as the peace congress. His speech on that occasion was an epoch-making
deliverance. In no uncertain tones he threw the influence of
his ministry on the side of peace and opened the door for the adoption
of a far-reaching proposition in favor of the submission of all questions
to investigation before hostilities are commenced. He used the North
Sea incident as an illustration and urged the extension of the powers of
the board of inquiry. His now famous exclamation, "The Duma is
dead&mdash;long live the Duma," illustrates both his moral courage and his
devotion to representative government. The sentence was a part of his
peace congress speech and was uttered in the presence of the duma
representatives who left Russia before the proroguing of that body. It
electrified the audience and has been widely commented on throughout
Europe.</p>

<p>Few premiers have had so large a majority back of them or possessed
so fully the confidence of their supporters, and the program prepared
by the ministry is a most comprehensive one. It is too much to
expect that the Liberal majority can be maintained on all the questions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
which will be under discussion, but it is evident that the new government
will have a number of important reforms to its credit when
it finishes its work.</p>

<p>The president of the House of Lords, the lord chancellor, is one of the
most popular of the Liberal leaders. His name is Robert Reed and he
is also a Scotchman. He is a rare combination and one of the most
lovable of men. There is a striking resemblance between him and the
Edinburgh statue of
Walter Scott and in
his heart there is the
democracy of Burns.
With high ideals, an
eloquent tongue and
a disposition which
attracts men to him,
he is especially fitted
for public life, and
it is to be regretted
that upon retirement
from his present position
he becomes a
judge, for the bench
does not afford an
equal opportunity
with the forum for
the molding of public
opinion.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 275px;"><a name="banner" id="banner"></a>
<img src="images/ill206.jpg" width="275" height="372" alt="banner" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">SIR HENRY CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The foreign secretary,
Sir Edward
Grey, is a man who
would attract attention
anywhere by
the strength of his
face. He reminded
me of the late William
Evarts, of New York. He played an important part in the
campaign which led up to the Liberal victory and his selection was regarded
as a fitting one. His position, however, is not so difficult to fill,
because Great Britain's relations with the other powers are quite
amicable.</p>

<p>We extended our stay in London in order to hear the minister of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
war, Mr. Haldane, make his argument in favor of a reduction in the
size and cost of the army. By the courtesy of our ambassador, Hon.
Whitelaw Reid, I had an excellent seat in the gallery of the House of
Commons. The reader may be interested in a brief sketch of this most
ancient of parliaments and most powerful of all the factors which enter
into the political life of the British Isles. The hall will seat sixty per
cent of the members&mdash;an astonishing fact to an American who is accustomed
to see each of his senators, congressmen and state legislators
occupying the seat assigned to him for the session. The members who
are present sit on cushioned benches, resembling church pews, and
these benches rise one above another on each side of the hall. The
Liberals sit on the right of the speaker and the front bench is reserved
for the ministry. The Conservatives occupy the benches at
the speaker's left, the front bench being reserved for the leaders of
the opposition. On the left, but farther from the speaker, are the
Irish members and the Labor members. There is a narrow gallery
on each side, which is occupied by members when there is a large
attendance, and there is a small gallery in the rear for visitors. The
ladies' gallery is just over the speaker's desk and is so carefully screened
that the occupants of the gallery can not be recognized from the floor.
While no one, least of all the ladies, seems to defend this screen, it
still remains. Most of the members wear their hats in the hall, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
as they have no desks they can not write when a colleague is speaking,
although I was told of one member who occasionally occupied his time
knitting.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="parliament" id="parliament"></a>
<img src="images/ill207.jpg" width="450" height="287" alt="parliament" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">HOUSE OF PARLIAMENT&mdash;LONDON.</p></div>
</div>

<p>As parliament virtually selects the ministers and as these ministers
are responsible to parliament rather than to the king, they must attend
the sessions at stated times and answer questions. Any member
of parliament is at liberty to submit a question in writing and
the minister is obliged to give answer, provided, of course, the answer
would not make an improper disclosure.</p>

<p>The leaders, facing each other from the opposing benches, present
a very interesting picture and after listening to the discussions
back and forth, one can understand why free speech has had so large
an influence in the development of the political institutions of Great
Britain. Here every idea is threshed out and every measure moulded
into permanent form.</p>

<p>But to return to the minister of war. Mr. Haldane might be taken
for Tom L. Johnson, Cleveland's redoubtable mayor, so much is he
like him in face and figure. He is plausible in speech and so good
natured that no one can be angry with him, however much he may
dissent from his conclusions. For two hours he held the attention
of the house and gallery&mdash;an unusual feat in London where the
speeches are not so long as in America. He was frequently encouraged
by cries of "Hear! Hear!" the usual applause in the House of Commons.
It was noticeable that the heartiest responses were drawn forth
by his expressions in favor of peace and arbitration. The reorganization
scheme which he presented provides for a reduction of several
thousand men and a considerable decrease in the total cost, but to make
the scheme more acceptable the remaining regiments are so disposed
as to give the country a larger fighting force than it now has. It was
interesting to watch the opposition benches, whose able leaders vigorously
attack everything that the new government proposes. Ex-War
Minister Foster followed Mr. Haldane and picked flaws in his plans,
but he did not receive the attention accorded the war minister.</p>

<p>The army question is arousing considerable interest, and the government
bill is likely to have more opposition in the House of Lords
than in the Commons. In fact, Lord Roberts has already attacked
the bill in advance, in a speech which affords conclusive proof of the
tendency of man to magnify his own calling. Nothing better illustrates
the conservatism of the House of Lords than the fact that the
Liberal party can claim but one-tenth of the membership of that
body while it has two hundred majority in the popular branch of
parliament. It must not be supposed, however, that all the bills<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
passed by the House of Commons will be defeated in the House of
Lords, for while a large majority of that house may really oppose a
measure, they recognize that the very existence of their body would
be jeopardized if it opposed the people on any important question.
Nominally the House of Lords has an equal voice with the House of
Commons, in the enactment of laws, but as a matter of fact it does
not dare to exercise the power which it has.</p>

<p>The navy department has reduced the appropriation for large vessels,
and it is certain that at the next Hague conference Great Britain
will be found supporting a proposition for the limitation of armaments.
Mr. Edmund Robertson, the financial secretary to the admiralty,
presented the government's scheme for reduction and made
a favorable impression upon the House of Commons.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 250px;"><a name="morley" id="morley"></a>
<img src="images/ill208.jpg" width="250" height="319" alt="morley" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">JOHN MORLEY, M. P.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The minister of education, Mr. Birrell, has been the busiest of the
ministers so far. He has had charge of the educational bill which has
been under discussion for several months and which, after being perfected
in the committee
of the whole, has been
passed to a third reading
by a majority of a hundred
and ninety-two. As
the bill deals with religion
as well as education
and concerns the
children of the country,
it arouses deep interest.
In England the public
school system has grown
up as an addition to the
church schools, or rather
the public schools have
supplemented the work
formerly done by the private
schools. As these
schools increased in numbers
and importance the
church schools began to
ask for a division of the
school funds and this, as
it usually does, brought
into politics the question of religious instruction in the schools. As
long as the private schools were supported by private contribution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
or endowment their religious instruction was entirely in their own
hands, but when these schools began to draw their support from the
public treasury the taxpayers objected to paying for instruction in the
creed of any other church than their own. Four years ago the Conservatives
enacted a law which gave to the Established Church of England
considerable advantage over the nonconformist churches in the
management of the public schools, and this led to a campaign against
the law by the nonconformists. Their opposition to the conservative
government contributed not a little to the Liberal victory and the bill
now under consideration in parliament puts them upon an equal
footing with the members of the Established Church in respect to
schools and removes the tests which formerly operated against nonconformist
teachers.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Mr. John Morley, the secretary for India, is too well known in
America to require an introduction. He stands in the front rank
of English men of letters and his appointment has given new hope to
the people of India. In presenting the Indian budget a few days
ago he promised a reduction of taxation&mdash;especially the detestable salt
tax, and said that a commission was inquiring how far the doctrine
of self government could be applied to the people of India. The fact,
however, that but a few hours were devoted to Indian affairs, while days
and weeks are given to home problems, shows how far the interests
of citizens are placed above the rights of remote subjects.</p>

<p>Mr. James Bryce, the secretary for Ireland, is also well known in
the United States, his American Commonwealth being a standard
work among us. He brings to his duties wide experience and a splendid
mind and, what is more important, an excellent heart. His sympathies
are broad and he has enough Irish blood in his veins to
insure an equitable view of Irish problems.</p>

<p>The prime minister made an excellent selection when he named
Mr. John Burns as president of the local government board. In this
position Mr. Burns has to deal with the subjects to the study of which
he has devoted his life, namely, labor and municipal affairs. Having
worked his way up from the ranks he is able to give invaluable
assistance in all matters pertaining to wage-earners, factory inspection
and municipalization. He is a tower of strength to the Liberal ministry.</p>

<p>Mr. Winston Churchill, son of the late Lord Randolph Churchill,
as the representative of the colonial department in the House of Commons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
has to deal with the Chinese question in South Africa, one of
the leading questions of the recent campaign. The new government
has undertaken to abolish a system of contract labor which has been
described as little short of slavery. The mine owners insist that
Chinese labor is necessary for the successful working of the mines and
that the conditions imposed upon the Chinese are not severe, but the
laboring men of Great Britain are quite unanimous in their condemnation
of the system and the Liberal government is supporting their
views. Mr. Churchill is a brilliant young man and has, as his friends
believe, a bright future. The fact that his mother is of American
birth gives him a more than usual interest in our country and makes
us watch his career with a friendly eye. His connection with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
important work of framing a constitution for the Transvaal is likely
to largely increase his political prominence.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="burns" id="burns"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">JOHN BURNS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>I have left for the last the chancellor of the exchequer, although in
order of importance his office stands near the head of the ministry.
Mr. Henry Asquith, the present occupant of this position, is one of
the strongest members of the Liberal party and probably its foremost
debater. He was put forward to reply to Mr. Chamberlain in the
tariff controversy and acquitted himself well. He is opposed to the
protective tariff, whether levied for the aid of particular industries
or as a part of the scheme of retaliation and his ideas are, for the present
at least, in the ascendancy. If the Right Honorable Joseph Chamberlain,
with the prestige given him by the Boer war and with his extraordinary
ability as a public speaker, can not overthrow England's free
trade policy there is little chance that any other English statesman will
be able to attack it successfully in the near future.</p>

<p>Mr. Asquith's department has the administration of the income
tax and inheritance tax. The latter has yielded more within the
last year than ever before, three large estates having turned into the
treasury (or will do so) some twenty millions of dollars. The income
tax is not only a permanent part of the fiscal system, but a commission
is considering whether a graded income tax should not be substituted
for the present uniform one. The tax is now uniform, except that
small incomes are exempt.</p>

<p>Besides the measures above referred to, the new government is preparing
a home rule measure for Ireland and proposes to so change the
election laws as to reduce the land holders to one vote each&mdash;at present
each land holder can vote in every district in which he has land.
The government is also supporting a measure which protects the English
tenant farmers in their improvements and in their right to vote
according to their own views, irrespective of the wishes of the landlord.
The Liberal victory was a victory for progressive, democratic ideas and
the new government is earnestly at work putting these ideas into the
form of law.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLI.</h2>

<h3>HOMES AND SHRINES OF GREAT BRITAIN.</h3>


<p>He who sees only the cities and villages of Great Britain misses one of
the most interesting features of English life. Land tenure is so different
here from tenure in the United States that the reader will pardon a
sketch of the old-fashioned manor. In England, the right of primogeniture
still remains and the family home descends to the oldest son.
It not only descends to him, but it continues its descent through him
to his son and his son's son, and is not subject to alienation. It was our
good fortune to be invited to several of these homes, some of them rich
in family heirlooms and of historic interest.</p>

<p>Our ambassador, Mr. Reid, is occupying one of the most famous
estates in England; it is known as Wrest Park and is about forty miles
from London. During the London season, many spend the "week's
end" at their country home, and after a fortnight's experience in
London we could appreciate the necessity for it, for the dinner hour
is eight or eight fifteen, while receptions and balls begin at any hour
from ten to twelve. The House of Commons does not convene until
three o'clock in the afternoon, and generally sits until midnight. Little
wonder that there is an exodus on Saturday morning.</p>

<p>We spent our first week's end at Wrest Park and were shown
through its spacious grounds. The house itself is only about seventy
years old, but the land has been in the hands of the family for several
centuries. The estate consists of about seven thousand acres, most of
it in cultivation, but enough is left adjoining the house for woods,
parks, lawns and gardens, and these have been laid out and ornamented
by landscape gardeners. There are walks lined with statuary,
green stretches of velvet turf, miles of well kept hedges of holly and
box and cedar, stately oaks, summer houses, tea houses, green houses
and everything in the way of ornament that taste could dictate and
money supply. The gardens are especially attractive. They were shut
in by high walls, and against these walls fruit trees, vines and flowers
are trained with artistic effect. In the hot houses peaches are ripening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
before their season, and huge bunches of grapes are growing purple.
Cucumbers, tomatoes and many other vegetables, as well as fruits
which we grow out of doors, are in England raised and ripened under
glass. The strawberries are of enormous size, and the gooseberries are
as large as pigeon eggs.</p>

<p>Within the house are spacious rooms hung with pictures of the
nobility that have occupied the estate, and of members of the royal
family who have visited there. The library contains several thousand
books accumulated through many generations.</p>

<p>Not far from the house stands the manor church supported by
tithes, the owner of the estate usually selecting the minister. In many
places the "living," as it is called, has ceased to be of great value.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="melrose" id="melrose"></a>
<img src="images/ill210.jpg" width="450" height="249" alt="melrose" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">MELROSE ABBEY.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The inheritance tax is quite a heavy burden upon the owners of
these estates, and many of the landholders are so impoverished that
they are obliged to rent their estates in order to raise the money to
meet the tax.</p>

<p>Mr. Moreton Frewen, who contributed many articles to the silver
literature in 1896, and whose wife is of American birth, took us down
to his place, Brede, which is within sight of the battlefield of Hastings.
It is a fine old house with a splendid view, and the oak doors and
woodwork, although five or six hundred years old, are as good as new.
On the way to Brede we stopped for luncheon at Knole, another
famous country place owned by the West family. The present occupant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
Lord Sackville West, was once Ambassador to America. It is a
historic place, and has seven courts, fifty-two stairways and three hundred
and sixty-five windows. The earliest record shows that the Earl
of Albemarle gave the estate to his daughter when she was married
to the Earl of Pembroke. Afterward, it came into the possession of
Lord Saye and Sele, and he conveyed it to the Archbishop of Canterbury,
who at his death bequeathed it to the See of Canterbury. Cranmer
occupied the place in the sixteenth century, and conveyed it to
Henry the Eighth. (Cranmer will be remembered as one of the three
bishops who were burned at the stake.) It was once in the possession
of Queen Mary and afterward of Queen Elizabeth, who conveyed it
to Dudley, her favorite Earl. The house is a veritable museum and
art gallery, and contains hundred of pictures, many of them of kings
and others prominent in English history. One of the rooms was fitted
up by James First for himself when he paid a visit to Knole, and the
room is kept as it was. The bed is said to have cost forty thousand
dollars, and the curtains and bed cover are embroidered with gold and
silver. The mattresses are of white satin, and the walls are hung with
Flemish tapestry representing scenes from the history of Nebuchadnezzar.</p>

<p>The great hall used as a dining room is seventy-five feet long and
half as wide. At one end is a raised floor where the table of the Lord
of the Manor stood; below him sat the retainers and lower members
of the household. A list of one hundred and twenty-six names is preserved,
that being the number of those who regularly took their meals
in the hall in 1624. In this hall there is a large collection of silver
and pewter vessels handed down from generation to generation. The
grounds and gardens, I need hardly add, are in keeping with the interior
of the castle. We saw here one of the prettiest specimens of the
skill of the horticulturist's art that has come under our observation.
Grape vines are grown in large pots and trained upon a hoop-like
trellis. When we were there the clusters of ripened grapes added to
the beauty of the vines.</p>

<p>We spent one night at Broughton Castle as the guests of Lord and
Lady Lennox. The host and hostess have often visited the United
States, and are quite liberal in their political views. They are also
identified with the community, encouraging artistic industry such as
wood carving and the like, by which the young people may add to
their income as well as develop their taste. In this connection it
should be explained that the owner of an estate occupies a responsible
position. While he draws rent from his tenants, he is expected to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
their patron and protector, as well as their general advisor. He provides
the Christmas festivities, gives presents to the children and looks
after the sick.</p>

<p>The moral standards which he sets up have a large influence upon
the religious and social life of the community, and the conscientious
land owner is able to do a great deal of good.</p>

<p>Broughton Castle is near Banbury&mdash;the Banbury Cross, immortalized
in child rhymes by the woman "who rode a white horse"&mdash;and
was frequented by Cromwell and his chiefs. In fact, in one of the
rooms, as tradition goes, the death warrant of Charles the First was
signed. The house is of stone and the roof is covered with stone tiles&mdash;and
a good roof it still is, though six hundred years old. In some of
the rooms fine oak paneling had been painted over, and in other
rooms handsome stone walls had been disfigured with plaster, but the
present occupant is restoring these. As in many of the larger and
older country places, Broughton has a little chapel of its own where
the family assembled for divine service. The castle is surrounded
by a shaded lawn, ornamented by hedge, evergreens, flower beds and
rose-covered arbors, and around all these runs the moat, fed from
neighboring streams. The memory of feudal times is preserved by
the towers, drawbridge and massive gates. English history is illuminated
by these ancient country seats, and much in English home life
is explained that would otherwise be difficult to understand.</p>

<p>Warwick Castle is near Lemington and but a few miles from
Broughton. It is probably the most visited of all the castles of England
and is still in the family of the Earl of Warwick, the king maker.
It is built upon the banks of the Avon and has a deep, dark dungeon
and lofty towers and all the accessories of an ancient fortress. The
great hall is filled with armor and heirlooms. The house contains a
valuable collection of paintings by old masters and the furniture of
the sleeping rooms is as remarkable for its design as for its antiquity.
A few weeks ago a pageant, illustrating the history of the castle, was
given on the banks of the stream and attended by some twenty thousand

<p>So much for the great estates of England. They are still maintained
and the system is still defended by manly English statesmen
as the one best calculated to preserve the family and the present social
structure. There does not seem to be as much opposition here as
an American would suppose to this system, under which priority of
birth carries with it so great an advantage over those born afterward.
The younger children, reared to expect little except in case of the death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
of those older, seem to accept the situation as a matter of course, and
tenants, descended from generations of tenants, seem to acquiesce without
protest in a tenure which deprives them of the prospect of ownership.
While one can appreciate the beauty of the manors and admit
that they could not be maintained under any other system than that
which gives them entire to one member of the family and prevents
alienation, still an American finds his admiration for American institutions
increasing while he travels, for to him the advantages that
flow from individual ownership, and the division of estates at death,
seem infinitely greater than any that are to be derived from the English
system. A hundred farmers, stimulated by hope and secure in
their holdings, contribute more than one country gentleman and
ninety-nine tenants possibly can to the strength and vigor of a state.</p>

<p>After all, the large estates are insignificant in number when compared
with the homes of the middle classes in the various cities and
villages, but these are so much like the homes in America, both in
appearance and in management, that it is not necessary to dwell upon
them. The owners of these homes are potent in parliamentary elections,
as are also the laboring men. The House of Lords represents
the landed proprietors, more than one-third of all the farm lands
in England being owned by members of that body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span></p>

<p>We took occasion to visit some of the shrines of Great Britain. Of
course, no one place is so rich in historic memories as Westminster
Abbey, it being the burial place of most of the illustrious of England.
One of the most frequented places outside of London is Stratford-on-Avon,
the birthplace and burial place of Shakespeare. The house in
which he was born is still standing and is well preserved, considering
the years that have passed over it. From its size and arrangement it
is evident that Shakespeare's father was a man of some means. The
house is now public property and serves as a museum where numerous
Shakespearian relics are exhibited. One oil painting of him, made
when he was still a young man, would indicate that even then he enjoyed
some distinction among his fellows, although succeeding generations
have appreciated him vastly more than his own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span></p>

<p>The grammar school which Shakespeare attended is still to be seen,
and at the church they have the baptismal font used at his christening
and the parish register in which his baptism and burial are entered.
His grave is in the floor of the church and there is nothing to mark
the stone slab that covers it but the familiar lines:</p>

<span class="i1">Bleste be ye man yt spares thes stones,</span>
<span class="i1">And curst be he yt moves my bones."</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>At Edinburgh we saw the home of John Knox and were impressed
anew with the tremendous influence which he exerted upon the religious
life of Scotland. Seldom has it fallen to the lot of one man to
so stamp his thought upon so many people. In Edinburgh also stands
the little chapel, less known to tourists, in which the Covenanters met
and in which the struggle began between them and the Church of
England. It is hard to believe that so short a time ago there was a
bloody war between two branches of the Protestant Church, in which
thousands suffered martyrdom for their religious convictions.</p>

<p>We visited Loch Katrine and Loch Lomond, to which Scot has
given a permanent place in literature, and after seeing them will not
enter into a dispute with any Highlander, however extravagant his
praise of these beautiful lakes. And if I may digress for a moment, we also
visited the lakes of Killarney of which Moore sang. They also are
beautiful enough to move a poet's heart and inspire a poet's pen, although
to be truthful I must assert that Lake Tahoe, which shines like
a jewel in the crown of the Sierras, on the boundary line between California
and Nevada, need not fear comparison with any of the lakes of
Scotland or Ireland. In one thing, however, we cannot compare with
England, Scotland and Ireland, namely, the ivy-mantled ruin. It is
picturesque and pleasing to the eye and yet who would exchange a plain
cottage, occupied by a happy family, for the crumbling vine-clad walls
of a tenantless castle?</p>

<p>From Glasgow we went by automobile to Ayr, the birthplace of
Burns. Thirty-three miles out and thirty-three miles back, and it
rained nearly the entire way! We were sustained amid the discomforts
of the trip by our interest in Scotland's rustic bard, whose simple
lays have endeared him to the universal heart, but our sympathies
went out to two kind friends, Mr. McKillup, a member of parliament,
and Mr. Henry Wright, a Glasgow barrister, who accompanied
us. It was an humble cottage in which Burns first saw the light and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
in which he lived when he made the acquaintance of those rollicking
companions, Tam O'Shanter and Souter Johnny. Near by is the
famous bridge over the "Bonny Doon" of whose "banks and braes"
he sang, and not far away are the old bridge and the new one which
his fancy clothed with life and brought together in animated dialogue.
After visiting the places and looking upon the scenes enshrined in
literature by his verse one reads with even greater zest the homespun
ballads of this impulsive apostle of democracy. I was glad to learn
that increasing thousands wend their way to his birthplace each year
and that among the visitors Americans are very numerous.</p>

<p>We reserved for the conclusion of our tour of the British Isles Hawarden
Castle, the home of Gladstone. With our usual luck we reached
Hawarden just as Mr. Henry Gladstone arrived from his home, eight
miles away, and were taken through the house and grounds by him.
The estate of several thousand acres, which came into the family from
Mrs. Gladstone's ancestors, has just passed, according to the law of
primogeniture, into the hands of a grandson of Mr. Gladstone. The
new owner is a sober, studious young man who has already achieved
distinction in college debates and who is preparing himself for a
public career. While we enjoyed a drive through the woods and
through the park, where the elder Gladstone was wont to cut down
trees for exercise, our interest naturally centered in the big, roomy
house, castle-like in its structure, and in the commodious library where
England's Christian statesman labored for more than threescore years,
for it must be remembered that his public life extended over two generations.
The walls are concealed by books, and shelves jut out into
the room at right angles. Gladstone was a prodigious worker and,
amidst the cares of official life, found time to devote to the classics,
to the sciences and to religious discussion. Among the busts in the
room is one of Disraeli, his most conspicuous political antagonist. The
prominence thus given to his distinguished opponent may possibly be
explained, as Hercules explained the courtesy shown by him to the
goddess whose enmity compelled him to perform the labors which
made him immortal.</p>

<p>Opening off from the library is a fireproof vault in which Mr.
Gladstone kept his papers and valuable documents, and he was so
methodical that Mr. John Morley, his biographer, found the materials
for his work in excellent order. Not far from the house is a large
building, erected as a memorial to Gladstone, which contains his religious
library of several thousand volumes. The family has built
a dormitory adjoining the library to accommodate the students who
come from all countries to study theological questions.</p>

</div>

<p>We also visited the chapel near by where the statesman attended
church and often read the service. His son-in-law, the present rector,
showed us the memorial, since unveiled, which will draw multitudes
to this historic edifice. It is a marble group by the sculptor Richmond
and represents the great Commoner and his wife sleeping side
by side, an angel guarding them with outstretched wings. It is fitting
that they should thus rest at the end of life, for they had together borne
life's burdens and together shared the many triumphs that crowned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
their efforts. While he was master of the ship of state, she was mistress
of an ideal home; while he was seeking to ameliorate the condition
of the whole people, she was conducting a private orphanage within
a stone's throw of the castle, an institution still maintained in her
memory. So happy was the long married life of this well-mated pair
that at the approach of death he requested the family not to permit
his interment in Westminster Abbey, except on condition that his wife
be given a place beside him, and this unusual honor was paid them.</p>

<p>Although nations boast of material wealth and manufacturing
plants, their most valuable assets are their men and women of merit,
and their greatest factories are their institutions of learning, which
convert priceless raw material into a finished product of inestimable
worth. Gladstone, vigorous in body, strong in mind and elevated in
moral purpose, was an ornament to the age in which he lived and will
be an inspiration to succeeding generations.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLII.</h2>

<h3>GLIMPSES OF SPAIN.</h3>


<p>The peninsula which Spain and Portugal divide between them is
the part of western Europe least visited by Americans, although it
stretches out like a friendly hand toward the western hemisphere and
has furnished not only the discoverer of North America, but the
colonizers of Central and South America. When, early last June, we
attempted to secure homeward passage, we found the ships sailing
from Hamburg, Bremen and Antwerp already filled and had to look
to a Mediterranean boat for accommodation. I mention this experience
in the hope that it may help some other traveler who finds himself
in the same dilemma, for we not only secured satisfactory accommodations
on one of the North German Lloyd steamers, the Princess
Irene, but had in addition an opportunity to see the most backward
country in western Europe, the stronghold of the Moors during the
middle ages and one of the great fortresses of the globe.</p>

<p>A fast train makes the distance from Paris to Madrid in a little
over a day, the only drawback being that it passes through the
Pyrenees in the night. As we had remained in Paris longer than we
expected, we were deprived of a view of the mountain scenery and of
the summer resorts of northern Spain. Morning found us in the
very heart of Castile and the landscape resembles some parts of Mexico.
The country is in the midst of the dry season and, the grain
having been gathered, the fields look quite barren save for the vineyards.
These are numerous all over Spain and recall the fact that
Spain, like other colonizers, tried to make her colonies supplement
her own products rather than compete with them. She forbade grape
growing in Cuba, and in Mexico not only prohibited the culture of
the vine, but the production of silk also. Speaking of grapes, it is
only fair to say that, in this fruit, Spain cannot be surpassed. Nowhere
have we found grapes so abundant, so cheap or so delicious.
At a Vienna hotel last June they were asking three dollars for a
cluster&mdash;probably raised in a hot house&mdash;that in August could be
bought in Spain for ten or fifteen cents. The large white grapes
exported to the United States and sold as a luxury during the winter
months are here within the reach of all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span></p>

<p>All along the railroad one sees primitive agricultural methods.
The old-fashioned threshing floor is in common use, but instead of
the flail they employ a machine resembling a light disc harrow, which
is hitched to a pair of mules and drawn rapidly round and round.
When the wheat is separated from the straw, men go over the threshing
floor and winnow out the wheat, the wind blowing away the
chaff. We were informed that they had had a prosperous year in
the grain districts, but the stubble did not indicate as heavy a crop
as we raise in the United States.</p>

<p>Madrid surprised us. It contains more than half a million of
inhabitants, is about two thousand feet above the sea and is really a
very attractive city. It is not an ancient city, being less than a thousand
years old, but it has substantial blocks, a beautiful boulevard
and a picture gallery one and a half centuries old. In the different
galleries at Madrid are some of the best canvases of Velasquez and
Murillo.</p>

<p>As in all other Spanish countries one finds here reminders of the
national sport, the bull fight. Each city has its amphitheater or circular
bull pit, and it is often the most conspicuous building in the
place; the fans&mdash;and in Spain the fan is omnipresent and often of
great value&mdash;are ornamented with scenes from the bull fight and the
bill boards blaze with announcements of the next Sunday's combat.
The bull fight is probably a lineal descendant of the gladiatorial contests
of Rome, a surviving relic of brutality, which must disappear
when Spain follows her northern neighbors in the adoption of universal
education. At present her percentage of illiteracy is disgracefully
large.</p>

<p>While Spain has a constitutional government and goes through
the form of electing a legislative body, her elections do not seem to be
characterized by the freedom and fairness that attend elections in
northern Europe. There is, however, in this country, as in others, a
growing spirit of reform which is already demanding more schools
and less religious interference in the government. Much is expected
of the present king, both because of the independence which he has
manifested and because the new queen comes from England, where
parliamentary government has for centuries been an established fact.</p>

<p>Before leaving Madrid a word should be said in regard to the
Toledo ware&mdash;iron and steel inlaid with gold. It resembles somewhat
the Damascene work of Japan and the old inlaid work of
Damascus and Constantinople. The far famed Toledo blade was not
less dangerous in war because it was ornamented with delicate tracery
of gold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span></p>

<p>A night's ride brought us to Cordova, once the Moorish capital of
Spain. It had been a city of some note under the Romans before the
Christian era, and the Moors undertook to make it a western Mecca
for the Mohammedans. There are still to be seen two gates and a wall,
which were built by the Romans, and a bridge which rests upon the
foundations laid by the great builders. The bridge with its massive
arches and ponderous piers is interesting for other than historic
reasons, as it gives evidence of the fact that the Moors were quick to
appreciate and to follow the example of their predecessors. In the
stream near the bridge are three grist mills dating from the middle
ages, one of which still supplies flour to the neighborhood.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="cordova" id="cordova"></a>
<img src="images/ill216.jpg" width="450" height="263" alt="cordova" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE OLD BRIDGE AT CORDOVA.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The old mosque, however, is the overshadowing object of interest
in Cordova, and in itself well repays a visit to this city of narrow,
winding streets and oriental appearance. The ground plan of the
mosque covers about two hundred and forty thousand square feet&mdash;nearly
as much as St. Peter's at Rome, but one-third of the space
is occupied by a court where the worshipers assemble and purify
themselves before entering upon their devotions. The mosque was
some four centuries in building, one ruler after another extending
its limits in order to accommodate the increasing number of converts.
In appearance the structure is low and flat and gives little idea of its
immensity. It is surrounded by a strong wall heavily buttressed and is
entered by huge gates. One of these gates bears striking testimony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
to a remarkable agreement entered into by the Christians and Mohammedans
whereby the two antagonistic religions divided the church
between them. These gates are covered with plates of bronze on which
Catholic and Arabic symbols alternate. The joint occupation did not
last very long, but Abderrahman, when he desired to secure more
room for the followers of the Prophet, was considerate enough to purchase
the other half from the Christians.</p>

<p>The interior of the mosque is a succession of arches supported by
nearly a thousand pillars and these pillars, the traveler is told, were
brought from Carthage, France and Italy. Workmen were secured
in Constantinople by one of the caliphs and it is possible to find
almost every variety of architecture in the columns themselves or in
their capitals and bases.</p>

<p>When Cordova was recaptured by the Christians in the thirteenth
century a part of this building was converted into a cathedral and
to-day it presents a curious combination of chapel, altar, shrine and
mosque. The most attractive decorations in the mosque are the
mosaics, and the superb wood carving in the principal choir are of
rare merit. One series of these pictures in wood illustrates Old Testament
history, while another portrays the principal events in the life
of Christ.</p>

<p>The road from Cordova&mdash;Cordova, once the center of art, Arabic
learning and religion, but now a prosaic town of less than sixty
thousand&mdash;to Granada, the last stronghold of the Moors north of the
Mediterranean, leads through a succession of olive groves. Nowhere,
not even in Palestine or about the mount that bears the olive's name,
have we seen such an abundance of these trees. From the importance
of this industry one would suppose that southern Europe could supply
olive oil enough without importing cotton seed from the United
States, and yet we have been assured by shippers that a great deal of
the olive oil which we buy from Europe is really cotton seed oil, which
has twice crossed the Atlantic.</p>

<p>The city of Granada is situated at the foot of the Sierra Nevada,
upon whose summit some snow still lingered when two-thirds of the
month of August had passed. The city stretches back towards the
mountains and derives its food supply from a splendid valley which
extends toward the west to the Atlantic. At one time Granada had
a population of two hundred and fifty thousand, but to-day less than
a third of that number can be counted in the city. In the height of
its glory Granada's kings held court in oriental fashion and surrounded
themselves with a luxury which the colder countries of the
north did not attempt to imitate. When the Indians roamed over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
prairies and hunted through the forests of the western hemisphere,
the Arab ruler had his palace on the height of Alhambra and, turning
his face toward Mecca, prayed for the extermination of the infidel;
his warriors went out from this fortress to ravage the surrounding
country and, returning laden with spoil, held high carnival on the
banks of the Darro. The fairest of the women of his race were gathered
into the harem and flowers and fountains gave perfume and
freshness to his habitation.</p>

<p>Washington Irving has contributed so much to literature on the
Alhambra and its legends that it is not necessary to undertake a
description of this fascinating palace of the Moorish kings. It crowns
a hill much as the Parthenon crowns the Acropolis, or as the summer
residence of Mexico's president crowns Chapultepec. Irving found
the palace neglected and occupied by wandering families whose members
felt no interest in its preservation. He helped to arouse an interest
in the place which has led the government not only to protect it
from further vandalism, but to restore many of its parts. Its rooms,
halls, audience chambers, courts and baths are all finished in most
elaborate style. As in other Mohammedan buildings, the ornamentation
is in geometrical figures and flowers, as the followers of this
religion carry their aversion to idolatry so far that they do not use
human figures or even animals in decoration. The material employed
in the Alhambra is stucco and it is surprising what delicacy and grace
characterize the work. One finds here a reminder of the screens which
play so important a part in the tombs built by the Mohammedan conquerors
in India, except that in India marble is used.</p>

<p>To the American the room known as the Hall of the Ambassadors
is especially interesting because in this room, if the word of the
guide can be relied upon, Ferdinand and Isabella received Columbus
just before he embarked upon his voyage of discovery.</p>

<p>A part of the Alhambra was torn down by order of Charles the
Fifth, who, early in the sixteenth century, conceived the idea of building
himself a palace of modern design. The structure was never finished,
however, and stands to-day a ruin, more substantial but less
beautiful than the palace which it was intended to outshine. The Moors
built a great cistern within the outer walls of Alhambra and brought
water from the mountains to supply it. It is so far below the surface
that the water is always cool and the water is so perfectly filtered that
even now it is greatly sought for drinking. This far-sighted provision
not only for present wants, but for possible siege, seems to have been
characteristic of the Moors, for the city of Constantinople was likewise
protected by immense underground reservoirs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><a name="spain" id="spain"></a>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span></p>

<p>Granada has a considerable gypsy population. From the Alhambra
one can see their dwellings on an opposite hillside. The rooms are
hewn out of the stone, with only the door visible. All in all, Granada
offers as much of variety as one can find anywhere in Europe and
more glimpses of the oriental life of the past than can be seen anywhere
else west of the Bosphorus.</p>

<p>The rock of Gibraltar has no advertising matter on it. In this
respect only does it differ from the photographs with which every
reader is familiar. It is, however, larger than the pictures indicate.
It is an immense limestone formation rising abruptly from the water
to a height of fourteen hundred feet. It is about three miles long
and at the widest point three-quarters of a mile across. It is evident
that it was once an island, for the low, flat strip of ground which
connects it with the main land seems to have been formed by the
washing in of the sand. The triangular face of the rock, which is
usually photographed, looks toward the land instead of toward the
sea, the water front being much less imposing. A town of twenty-six
thousand inhabitants has grown up around the base of the rock, fully
twenty per cent of the population being made up of the English
garrison. It is strictly a military town and the government does not
encourage the settlement of civilians there. The rock is full of concealed
cannon and is supposed to be impregnable. It seems to be
perforated with galleries and one sees the nose of a cannon poked out
at every commanding point. When the wind is from the east a cloud
hovers over the rock, sometimes concealing its summit. While the
harbor at Gibraltar is not an especially good one, it is one of the most
frequented in the world, and the dry docks will accommodate the
largest ships. Just beyond the rock of Gibraltar there is a strip of
neutral ground, one side sentineled by the British, the other by the
Spanish. Several thousand Spaniards enter the city every morning,
for all the manual labor is done by them, and return to their homes
at night. Just across the bay or harbor is the Spanish city of Algeciras
and, from both Algeciras and Gibraltar, boats cross the strait to
Tangiers, the Morocco capital.</p>

<p>We had planned to make this trip, but were deterred partly because
a revolution in Tangiers made it uncertain that we would be able to
land, and partly because unfavorable weather threatened to delay our
return.</p>

<p>I found at Gibraltar an instance of hereditary officeholding which
is not often paralleled among our people. The position of American
consul has been in one family for eighty-four years consecutively.
The present occupant, Mr. Sprague, is the third of his line to represent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
our government, his father, who held the office for over fifty
years, in turn succeeding his father. The present consul, Sprague,
is intensely American, notwithstanding the long residence of his
family outside the country.</p>

<p>As the traveler leaves Gibraltar for the west he bids farewell to
Africa and to Europe at the same time&mdash;Gibraltar and a somewhat
similar rock on the opposite side of the channel, the two, anciently
known as the Pillars of Hercules, stand out in bold relief against the
sky. These rocks are not the last land, however, although the most
striking features. There is a point a few miles farther west known
as Tarifa which, according to tradition, was once occupied by bold
robbers who exacted tribute from all who passed by. It is even said
that our word tariff traces its origin to this Tarifa; if it be true that the
two words are related it is fitting that Tarifa should be the last thing
seen by the traveler on his departure, for the tariff is the first thing
which he encounters upon his arrival in America.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLIII.</h2>

<h3>A WORD TO TOURISTS.</h3>


<p>The articles of this series, taken in connection with the articles
written during a former visit to Europe, cover all of the countries
which I have visited, and nothing is left but to offer some generalizations
covering the more important questions discussed in the course
of these articles. First, as to routes of travel. We have found the trip
around the globe far more instructive than we had expected, and it
was entered upon for educational reasons. There is so much to see
and learn that one can occupy an indefinite time in travel. We set
apart a year for the trip and reached home sixteen days within the
limit. Those who have followed these letters will admit, I think, that
we have covered a great deal of ground and seen a great deal of the
world. If we were repeating the trip, I hardly know of any country
that we could afford to leave out, and I am satisfied that it is better
to start from the Pacific coast than from the Atlantic. One could
make the trip in half the time that we spent and see a great deal,
but he can see more if he has a year or two to spare for the journey.</p>

<p>If one desires to make the trip in six months, he should set apart
about two months for ocean travel. He could then devote two weeks
to Japan, ten days to China, a week to Manila, three weeks to India,
a week to Egypt, two weeks to the Holy Land, a week to Greece and
Constantinople, and the rest of the time to Europe. To go through
Korea would require ten days or two weeks more, but the Hermit
Kingdom is different from any other country, and its queer people
are worth seeing. Very few of the tourists have visited Pekin, and
yet, it is in some respects the most interesting of the Chinese cities.
The Manchu element of the Chinese population&mdash;the ruling element&mdash;can
only be seen at Pekin or in the northern districts. The Great
Wall is near Pekin, and the wall around the city of Pekin is even
more imposing than the great wall itself. The Altar of Heaven, the
most beautiful and elaborate sacrificial altar on earth, is in the suburbs
of the Chinese capital and in itself well repays a visit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span></p>

<p>Until recently Pekin could only be entered from the sea via Tientsin.
The railroad, however, from Pekin to Hankow was about
completed when we were there, and this greatly facilitates travel
through the interior. If one goes on through Korea, it is best to go on
to Pekin by water and then go on the railroad to Hankow and down
the Yangtse river to Shanghai.</p>

<p>Every American who visits the Orient should spend some days in
the Philippine Islands. He owes it to his country to do so. If he
will visit the schools, he will be convinced that there is increasing
intelligence in the islands, and he will not doubt that the people want
independence. An inspection of the factories will prove that the Filipinos
are industrious as well as intelligent.</p>

<p>It takes about two weeks to go from Singapore to Java and return,
but we remember that visit as one of the most delightful parts of the
trip. The ruined temple at Boro Boedoer, the delicious fruits, the
terraced hills, the far reaching rice fields and the shady drives linger
in one's memory.</p>

<p>To visit Ceylon, Burma and India requires a good deal of travel
upon the Bay of Bengal. We went to Ceylon, then back to Burma,
then on to Calcutta. Some go to Burma and then to India and return
to Ceylon from Bombay, but all three of these countries are interesting,
and one can hardly afford to pass by any of them. Burma is the
home of Buddhism, and one can learn more of the worship of Buddha
here than anywhere else. The yellow-robed priest with his begging-bowl
is everywhere present.</p>

<p>I have already discussed India and Egypt somewhat in detail, and
no traveler need be urged to visit these countries. Palestine, however,
is skipped by so many travelers that I may be pardoned a word of
advice. Of all the countries which we visited none interested us more
than the Holy Land, and no member of a Christian church can afford
to visit southern Europe or pass through the Suez canal without seeing
that portion of Asia which is immortalized by Bible history. The
ruins at Baalbek, in some respects the most remarkable in the world,
attract many to Beyrout, Damascus and the Lebanons, but the Sea
of Galilee, Jerusalem and the Jordan have lessons for the tourist of
far greater importance than can be derived from the ruins of heathen
temples.</p>

<p>If the reader lacks either time, inclination or means for a trip
around the world, he will find one of the shorter trips to Europe
only second in interest and value. The Mediterranean trip is a very
popular one. This, according to its length, permits a visit to Gibraltar,
Alexandria, Cairo, Palestine, Constantinople, Greece and Italy. From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
Gibraltar it is a short trip to Granada, Cordova and Madrid, and our
own experience leads me to commend this trip to the traveler. At
Cairo and Constantinople the Orient comes nearest to Europe and
America, and the difference between the Orient and the western world
is so striking that no one visiting southern Europe should miss the
Nile and Bosphorus. One can spend weeks, and even months,
about the shores of the Mediterranean; Africa, Asia Minor and Europe
all touch upon this great inland sea. Without leaving its shores one
can study the most opposite types which the human race has produced
and at the same time study the history of the oldest periods known
to man. Egypt should be visited before the end of March, while
April is the best month for a trip to Palestine.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">VESUVIUS AS SEEN FROM NAPLES.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In Italy alone one could occupy a winter. Rome, the center of the
Catholic world and the home of the Cæsars, is a most fascinating
city. There are no mosaics like those of St. Peters and few galleries
equal those of the Vatican, while masterpieces of sculptors and painters
are to be found on every hand. The old Roman forum is the
Mecca of the student, and the Coliseum is still a wonder, defying as
it has the storms of nearly two thousand years. At Naples one sees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
Vesuvius and lava beds formed but a few months ago. At one place
the stream of lava poured through an archway and hardened as it
cooled. When we were there the lava was like stone and could with
difficulty be broken. At Florence one sees the best specimens of modern
sculpture, and at Milan he visits one of the most famous of the
European cathedrals.</p>

<p>Venice is in a class by itself. No other city rivals it in uniqueness.
Its streets are canals, and gondolas are the vehicles in which potentate,
priest and plebeian ride. It draws visitors from all over the world
and sends them away, after a short visit, glad that they came and
equally glad to escape from the dampness of the place.</p>

<p>If one desires a summer trip, he can find few journeys more delightful
than those through Switzerland and along the Rhine. Lakes,
rivers and mountains&mdash;these are to be found in abundance, with
cities enough to supply the population and hotels to accommodate the
the tourists. If one would combine pleasure with instruction, he can
profitably employ considerable time in visiting the German universities
at Heidelberg and Leipsic and the art galleries at Dresden and
Munich. The cathedral at Cologne, it may be added, is by many
preferred to the cathedral at Milan.</p>

<p>The northern portions of Europe are even more inviting to the
summer tourist than Switzerland or the Rhine. The lakes of Ireland
and Scotland and the seacoast resorts of England and Holland give
rest and recuperation to multitudes every year. If I were going to
suggest a summer trip, it would be as follows:</p>

<p>Leave New York early in June, land at Liverpool, cross over to
Newcastle and take a steamer for Bergen, Norway. A week can be
spent delightfully in the fjords and on the lakes in the neighborhood
of Bergen. Such a combination of deep water and rugged mountain
sides, rushing streams and crystal lakes is hard to find. Then let the
tourist proceed to Trondhjem, the ancient capital, where King Haakon
was recently crowned. From Trondhjem, the traveler can reach the
Arctic circle in a little more than a day. While a day's stay is sufficient
in the land of the midnight sun if the sky is clear, it is better
to allow one's self two or three days' leeway as it is often cloudy in
this latitude and at this time of the year. The midnight sun must
be seen to be appreciated. No description can do it justice. To pass
from day to day with no intervening night, to watch the sun linger
for a while in the north near the horizon and then begin a new day's
work without a moment's sleep gives one a sensation not soon forgotten.
A railroad across Norway brings Christiania within a day's ride
of Trondhjem, and from Christiania to Stockholm is another day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span></p>

<p>Stockholm is sure to charm the visitor. It is a beautiful town
beautifully situated; it stands where the waters of the lakes and the
ocean meet. Several days can be spent in Stockholm to advantage,
and then one is prepared for the boat ride to St. Petersburg, one of
the rarest experiences that one can find in travel. The boat wends its
way through islands almost the entire distance.</p>

<p>A week's stay in St. Petersburg will give an opportunity for an
inspection of the capital of the greatest of the nations measured by
territory, and one of the greatest measured by population. Here one
has a chance to learn something of the Greek Church with its splendid
cathedrals, rivaling the cathedrals of the Roman Catholic Church.
Moscow is even more distinctly Russian than St. Petersburg, and the
art gallery there surpasses the one at St. Petersburg in its collection
of the works of Russian artists. Tolstoy's summer home is not far
from Moscow, and many take advantage of the trip to see the greatest
of living philosophers.</p>

<p>The ride from St. Petersburg to Moscow and from Moscow to Warsaw
gives a very good view of the interior of Russia, and one can stop
off at most any place and learn something of the village life of the
Russian peasant. Several days can be occupied in Berlin, and other
points of interest can easily be reached from Germany's capital. Copenhagen,
the capital of Denmark, is only half a day's ride distant. Hanover,
Hamburg, Brussels, Amsterdam and The Hague are all within
easy reach. In Germany one has an opportunity to learn a great
deal about forestry, agriculture and landscape gardening. The parks,
groves, shady drives and boulevards furnish the American traveler
with many suggestions while the battlefield of Waterloo and the lowlands
of Holland will ever be interesting to the student of history.</p>

<p>The tour can be completed by a visit to Paris and London. The
social season in the latter ends early in August with the adjournment
of parliament. In three months' time one can make this northern
trip and return with a fund of information about the countries and
their peoples which could never be collected from books. It is not
an expensive trip even for first class travel, and the accommodations
furnished by the steamers and railroads for second class passengers
are such that one can reduce his expenses considerably without discomfort.</p>

<p>But let me add, in conclusion, that one does not have to leave
America to find places of interest and that no one can justify a trip
abroad until he has become acquainted with his own country. Europe
has no summer resorts that surpass the cities on the St. Lawrence, on
our northern lakes and in the mountains of the west. In America one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
can have every variety from salt-sea bathing to mountain climbing,
with fishing thrown in. In natural scenery there is nothing in Europe
which surpasses the Niagara, Yellowstone Park, and the Yosemite
Valley of California. There are no agricultural views which surpass
those in the valleys on the Ohio, the Mississippi and the Missouri, and
for a restful winter trip Hawaii, Mexico and Cuba offer attractions
that are unexcelled. While the Western Hemisphere is not so old in
its civilization, the only advantage that the Orient and Europe can
furnish is in the variety of races, customs and religions. In natural
scenery America satisfies all expectations. Nothing but the Himalayas
offers more sublime heights, and the earth has no other chasm
equal to the Grand Canyon of Arizona. After one has seen the wonders
of America and the possibilities of its soil, its institutions and its
people, he can go abroad with the assurance that he will return, more
widely informed, it is true, but more intensely American than before.
There is no country like ours, whether it be measured by the bountiful
gifts of the Creator or by the works of man. In all that goes to make
a nation great materially, commercially, intellectually, politically and
morally, our country has no peer. The American, returning to his
own shores, feels like thanking Scott for expressing so felicitously the
traveler's sentiments:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLIV.</h2>

<h3>AMERICAN FOREIGN MISSIONS.</h3>


<p>In former letters I have mentioned the missionary work being done
by Americans in the Orient, and I deem the subject important enough
for an article, in view of the conflicting reports which have been
brought back by tourists. We had an opportunity to investigate the
work done by American missionaries in Hawaii, Japan, Korea, China,
Singapore, India, Egypt, Palestine and Turkey. We met representatives
of nearly all the churches in the various departments of missionary
work, and as a result of our observations our interest in foreign
missions has been quickened. In Hawaii the missionaries laid the
foundation for the present civilization in the islands and exerted a
most beneficial influence upon the natives.</p>

<p>In Japan the missionary work has spread rapidly and is carried
on under four heads. The religious teacher presents the gospel and
establishes churches; the school teacher arouses an interest in education
and establishes schools; the medical missionary, by unselfishly
rendering obvious service, opens the way for both the preacher and
the school teacher, while the Young Men's Christian Association and
its accompanying organization, the Young Women's Christian Association,
weld the church membership into a religious but unsectarian
working body. The rapid growth in public instruction has somewhat
dwarfed the relative importance of the mission schools in Japan,
and the spread of the science of medicine has made the work of the
medical missionary less conspicuous there, but the religious teacher
in Japan has a field which is not surpassed anywhere. The Japanese
people are rapidly drifting away from Buddhism, which until recently
was the national faith. Shintoism, which has become the state religion,
is not a religion at all, but a reverence for ancestors. Japan must
have a religion, for no nation is likely to avoid decay unless its morals
are reinforced by religion. If I had the authority to decide the question,
I would send some of the leading men of each denomination
to Japan to present Christianity to the educated Japanese. English
is taught in the schools of Japan, and one can speak to the Japanese
without the aid of an interpreter. This proposition I tested several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
times. While it would be an advantage to have preachers who could
speak the Japanese language, still, it is more important that we should
send our ablest divines there&mdash;men who can meet the most intelligent
of the Japanese upon an equal footing and defend before them the
Christian philosophy of life.</p>

<p>Japan is the gateway of the Orient, and is to-day exerting an influence
upon China greater than the combined influence of all the
European nations. Western civilization is likely to enter China
through Japan. In fact, I believe that the Christian religion, presented
to the Chinese by the Japanese, would spread more rapidly
than if presented in any other way, for China has come to regard
Japan as a leader of thought. More than five thousand Chinese
students are now at schools in Japan, and Japanese teachers are being
more and more employed in China. Some of the most earnest Christians
whom we met are natives of Japan. At Tokyo, at Kioto, and at
Kagoshima I was especially impressed with the sincerity and enthusiasm
of the Japanese Christians. I could not but recall the lines
"Blest be the tie that binds our hearts in Christian love" as I saw
how much stronger this heart tie is than the ties of blood or race or
language.</p>

<p>In Seoul, Korea, we found a very successful medical mission and a
flourishing Young Men's Christian Association. We also learned of
several Christian congregations.</p>

<p>In China mission work has made great progress, although it has
had to bear the brunt of the fight now being made against foreign
influence. During the Boxer trouble there were examples of heroism
among the Chinese Christians which recalled the early days of martyrdom.
There were those who suffered death because of their
devotion to the Christian faith, and thousands more who did not hesitate
to take the part of the white Christians against members of their
own race. It takes time to educate a race or to make an impression upon
a great population like the population of China, but the next quarter
of a century is likely to see the Christian religion spread more rapidly
among the inhabitants of the Flowery Kingdom than it has during
the last century.</p>

<p>That our missionaries often make mistakes need not be denied.
They are human, and to err is the lot of all. A missionary among
strangers must exercise more sagacity and discretion than one who
works among people of his own race. The wonder is not that missionaries
make mistakes, but that they do not make more than are now
charged to them. It is even possible that a missionary occasionally
proves untrue to his calling&mdash;is it strange that this should happen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
to a missionary almost alone and with but little sympathetic support,
when it sometimes happens to ministers who are surrounded by friends
and hedged in so that a fall would seem almost impossible?</p>

<p>One part of the missionary's work has received scant notice, namely&mdash;the
planting of western ideas in the Orient. The daily life of a
missionary is not only a constant sermon, but to a certain extent, an
exposition of western ways. His manner of dress and his manner of living
are noted, and even if he did not say a word, he would make an
impression upon those about him. It would be worth while to send
Christians to the Orient merely to show the fullness and richness of
a Christian life, for, after all, the example of an upright person, living
a life of service according to the Christian ideal, is more eloquent than
any sermon&mdash;it is the unanswerable argument in favor of our religion.</p>

<p>It is sometimes suggested by those unfriendly to missionary work
that missionaries live in too great comfort. This criticism will not
have weight with those who have attempted to live in the Orient upon
the salary of a missionary, but even if the missionaries lived more
luxuriantly than they do, that would still exert a beneficial influence.
As the Chinaman becomes educated he learns of the manners and
customs of the people of other nations, and the home of the missionary
gives an opportunity for comparisons. In China there is polygamy,
while the missionary has but one wife. In the Chinese home the
birth of a son is the occasion for rejoicing; the birth of a daughter
an occasion for less rejoicing, if not actual mourning. In the missionary's
home the girl child is as welcome as the boy. The missionary's
wife is not only a standing rebuke to the practice of foot-binding, but
is a stimulus to the movement now setting in for the education of
women.</p>

<p>The Catholic missionaries reach a class which might not be reached
by Protestant missionaries and Protestant missionaries appeal to some
who could not be reached by the Catholic missionaries. Each church
does its own work in its own way, and the result is better than if either
church attempted to follow the example of the other. The celibacy
of the priest and his voluntary sacrifice of home and its joys that he
may more fully devote himself to religion&mdash;these appeal to some,
especially to those who have been impressed with the asceticism of the
religious teachers of the Orient. There are others, however, who are
more impressed with a form of Christianity which does not deny to
its ministers the advantages of the family. In other words, the
different branches of the Christian Church, each pursuing its own way,
meet the widely different needs of the heathen better than any one
church could do it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span></p>

<p>Missionary work in the Malay states has been very slow because the
Malays are nearly all Mohammedans, and it has been found difficult
to make headway against this religion. The Mohammedan believes
in one God, accepts most of the Old Testament, and regards Christ
as a great prophet, but claims that Mahomet was a later prophet and
a greater one.</p>

<p>Burma, the home of Buddhism, is one of the best missionary fields,
and great success has attended the Baptist mission, which has its
headquarters at Rangoon.</p>

<p>For many years American missionaries have been establishing schools
and churches in India. While this field has also been developed by
the English missionaries, I was informed that a majority of the
Sunday school children are now attending American Sunday schools.
It is one of the indisputable proofs of our country's supremacy in
altruistic work that though drawing nothing whatever from India in
the way of revenue, it sends into India every year for religious and
educational purposes almost as much as England does, notwithstanding
the fact that England draws something like a hundred millions a year
from India.</p>

<p>We found the various departments of Christian work growing vigorously
in India. Medical missionaries are winning the confidence
and the affections of the unfortunate; teachers are bringing increasing
thousands to a higher level of intellectual development; and the ministers
are explaining to the people why it is that the Christian is
sympathetic and benevolent. Simply stated, the medical missionary
compels attention, the school teacher takes the one whose attention
has been aroused and furnishes an education which enables the pupil
to see things in their proper relation, while the minister points out
the philosophy of the efforts of the other two and presents the conception
of life, which leads both medical missionary and teacher to separate
themselves from home and friends and devote themselves to people
who are connected with them only by the primal ties which bind
each human being to every other.</p>

<p>I shall long remember two meetings which I addressed in India.
One was held under the auspices of the Y. M. C. A. at Allahabad, one
of the centers of the Hindu religion. At the conclusion of my address
an Indian arose and addressed me as follows. "Mr. Bryan, you can not
judge of the influence of Christianity upon our country by the number
of church members. The spirit of Christ and the Christian ideal have
made an impression far wider than the church membership would indicate.
Tell your people that the Indians are grateful to them for the
missionaries and teachers whom they have sent among us, and tell them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
how few these are in number compared with our needs. Send us more,
and assure your people that we appreciate the benefits received from
America."</p>

<p>This unsolicited testimonial to the good work of our missionaries
and teachers is entirely deserved. The influence of Christianity upon
the Orient is vastly greater than one would think, if the church
membership were the test. The stimulus which is given to Eastern
thought is enormous, and already the Hindus, Parsees and Mohammedans
are imitating the methods of the Christian world and establishing
schools independent of the government. The education of
the boys is proceeding more rapidly than the education of the girls,
but the latter is not entirely neglected. One Mohammedan woman,
of Bombay, of unusual mental strength and character, outlined a plan
which she had formed for establishing a school for the women of
her religious faith.</p>

<p>The Bombay meeting was in some respects the most remarkable
meeting that I ever addressed. Rev. Mr. Mell, an American, is pastor
of the Methodist Church in Bombay. While in Calcutta I received a
letter from him asking me to deliver in Bombay, in his church, the
lecture entitled "The Prince of Peace," which I delivered at Tokyo
and at Manila. As the time approached for the meeting, he concluded
that his church would not be large enough for the audience and
arranged to secure the Town Hall, which accommodates about three
thousand people. He was somewhat fearful that this hall would be
larger than necessary, but it was the only audience room that he
could secure. When the time came for the meeting, the hall was not
only filled to overflowing, but the crowd outside was such that it was
difficult for us to effect an entrance. On the platform were prominent
Hindus, Mohammedans and Parsees, and three-fourths of the
audience, at least, was made up of non-Christian Indians. Yet these
people listened for more than an hour to a defense of the Christian
religion&mdash;listened as attentively as any audience ever listened to a
political speech, and when I went from the hall, the younger men
were massed along the way and cheered as our people cheer during
the campaign. The next day I received a letter from one of the
young men thanking me for shaking hands with him as I passed out.</p>

<p>In the letters on India I have referred to the Presbyterian college
at Allahabad. At Bombay we found a Congregational school for boys
and girls and a school for the blind. It touches one's heart to see
these sightless little Indians cared for by American philanthropy and,
under the teaching of sympathetic friends, made more capable of self-support
and raised to a higher intellectual level than millions who can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
see. Many of the children taken into these schools are orphans whose
parents died during the famines. What a history might be written
if the events of their lives were put on record, and how much evidence
would be furnished to those who endeavor to trace the providence
of God in the lives of individuals as well as in the course of nations.</p>

<p>I have in another article referred to the work of the United Presbyterians
in the valley of the Nile. It would be difficult to overestimate
the influence which these pioneer Americans have exerted over the
descendants of the Pharaohs. The government is giving more and
more attention to educational matters in Egypt, but the first work
was done by the missionaries, and no one can appreciate what this
work means who has not had an opportunity to compare the boys
and the girls in the schools with the children who are growing up in
ignorance outside. In Jerusalem the Catholic school for girls most
interested us, and I need not add that the Catholic missionaries have
in many countries been the first to risk their lives in the spread of the
the gospel and in the establishment of schools, orphan asylums and hospitals.</p>

<p>In Syria and in Turkey the Americans are very active. For half
a century they have made Beyrout headquarters for Syria, and their
churches and schools are scattered all over this portion of Asia. At
Constantinople also we met a large company of the representatives
of the various American churches, and their schools have been built
on both sides of the Bosphorus.</p>

<p>Why spend money on foreign missions? If the Oriental is happy
in his idolatry or in his worship of God through other religious forms,
why disturb him? These questions may be answered in various ways,
but one answer will suffice for the purpose of this article. The Christian
ideal of life is the highest ideal. There is no more beautiful conception
of life than that it is an overflowing spring. There is no true
measure of greatness except the Christian measure, namely&mdash;service.
If this ideal is good enough for America, it is good enough for all the
world. If truth must, according to eternal laws, triumph, then this
ideal must triumph over all lower ones, and how can it triumph over
lower ideals unless it is brought into contact with them? If we see
a man engaged in some useful work, but laboring with antiquated
tools, it is a kindness to him to offer him an implement that will
increase his effectiveness. If we see a man following a low ideal and
making but little of life, is it not a kindness to offer him a higher one
which will not only enlarge his usefulness but his happiness as well? If
the Christian ideal is worthy to be followed in America, it is worthy
to be presented in every land, and experience has shown that it is an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
ideal capable of being made universal, for it has commended itself to
people of every clime and of every tongue.</p>

<p>But it is said that we must not neglect home missions in our zeal
to carry the gospel and its attendant blessings to foreign shores. This
is a familiar objection, but as a rule it is urged by those who do the
least for home missions. I think I am far within the truth when I
say that the most liberal contributors to foreign missions are also the
most liberal contributors to home missions and that those who are
so afraid that work at home will be sacrificed for work abroad are
the very ones who themselves make few sacrifices for the work at
home. The same spirit which leads one to be generous in the support
of those benevolences which are immediately about him leads him to
take an interest in the needy wherever they are found. The same
spirit which makes one anxious to have the Sermon on the Mount
known in his neighborhood leads him to desire that the knowledge of
this sermon and the philosophy which it contains shall be brought to
the people of all the world.</p>

<p>There is another answer to those who say that we must confine our
efforts to the home field until we have supplied every moral need. If
an individual refuses to assist in the improvement of others until he
has himself reached perfection, who will be able to aid others? In
the effort to help others one often finds more improvement than could
come from a concentration of his efforts on himself. So the country
which refuses to extend a helping hand to other lands until all its
people have passed beyond the need of improvement will do nothing
for the world. As the contributions to benevolences would be small,
indeed, if only those contributed who could do so without sacrifice, so
the contributions to the world's advancement would be but slight if
only those helped others who were not themselves in need of help.</p>

<p>"Let him who would be the chiefest among you be the servant of
all;" if this is the measure of national greatness, then our nation is the
greatest of all, for its contributions to the world surpass the contributions
made by any other nation. These contributions are made in
three ways: First, it contributes through the men and women who
have come from other lands to study here, and who carry American
ideas back to their homes; second, through the men and women who
have gone to other lands as preachers and teachers; and, third, through
books and printed reports.</p>

<p>I venture the suggestion that it would be worth while to establish
schools in the United States where representatives of other nations
could be brought and made acquainted with Christianity and with
the institutions which have grown up in Christian society. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
could then go among their own people and preach with greater
effectiveness than foreigners possibly can.</p>

<p>Next to this comes the education of the natives in schools established
in their own land and this, of course, is far less expensive. From $40
to $50 a year will pay for the board, clothing and tuition of a student
in the lower classes of an Oriental Christian college. If the hundreds
of thousands of Christians who could, without sacrifice, educate one
student a year could be induced to contribute money for this purpose,
what an impetus would be given to the cause of Christianity throughout
the Orient! And who, when he remembers what has been accomplished
by one trained mind directed by a high and holy purpose, will
attempt to estimate the beneficent influence of money thus spent?
Who will set limits to the good that may be done by those Orientals
who are preparing themselves for larger work under the instruction
of American missionaries and teachers?</p>

<p>Making due allowance for the frailty of human nature and for the
mistakes which all are liable to make, it may be said without fear
of successful contradiction that the missionaries, physicians and
teachers who consecrate themselves to the advancement of Asia's
millions along Christian lines are as high minded, as heroic, as self-sacrificing,
and, considering the great destiny of the race, as useful as
any equal number of men and women to be found in any other part
of the world.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLV.</h2>

<h3>WORLD PROBLEMS.</h3>


<p>Each locality has its questions of interest; each state has subjects
which arouse discussion; each nation has its issues of paramount
importance, and the world has its problems. There are transient
questions which come and go and questions which, like Tennyson's
brook, "go on forever." Each generation, in each country, meets
the issues presented by conditions, but all the nations of the earth
are constantly grappling with problems universal in their scope and
everlasting in duration. In his famous oration at Gettysburg, Abraham
Lincoln spoke of an "unfinished work" which those buried there
had promoted and to which the living should dedicate themselves.
Every generation finds an unfinished work when it enters upon life's
stage and leaves the work unfinished when it departs. The work of
civilization is ever an unfinished one for the reason that new problems
present themselves as soon as present ones have been solved. In
our trip around the world we have had an opportunity to note some
of the problems which most concern all peoples at all times. The
first concerns the legitimate sphere of government&mdash;what should the
government, acting for all the people, do, and what should be left to
the individual? This problem is under consideration in every civilized
nation, and no two nations have reached the same solution. At
the two extremes stand the individualist and the socialist&mdash;the former
jealously guarding the individual and opposing any encroachments
upon his sphere of action, the latter emphasizing the work of the
state and seeking to convert the work of production and the work of
distribution into state functions. Between these extremes stand the
mass of the people, governed more by the exigencies of each individual
case than by the theories put forward by individualist and socialist.
In some directions the governments of Europe and Asia have extended
the sphere of the state beyond anything known in the United States;
in some respects our government has enlarged the sphere of the state
beyond anything attempted in the old world, but everywhere the
tendency is to extend rather than to diminish the sphere of the state's
activities.</p>

<p>In the United States the public school is probably the best illustration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
of extensive co-operation on the part of the public. We regard
the education of the people as a matter of public importance&mdash;so
vital a matter, in fact, that we no longer depend upon the private
school. The private school has its place, and its establishment is
encouraged by localities and regarded with favor by the government,
but the people, acting as a whole, insist that the school door shall
be open to every child born into the country. In the last quarter of
a century much advance has been made in the establishment by the
public of technical schools, such as law schools, medical colleges, dentistry
schools, industrial schools and agricultural colleges. Probably
the greatest comparative advance has been made in the matter of
agricultural colleges and experiment stations. In Europe the public
school system is spreading, more rapidly in northern than in southern
Europe, but not less surely in southern Europe. In Asia the people
are just beginning to recognize education as a public function&mdash;a part
of the state's work. In Japan public instruction has for some years
been modeled after the systems employed in the United States and
Europe. In Asia the public school is more of a modern origin, but
some idea of the rapidity with which the public school is spreading
in China may be known from the fact that four thousand public
schools have been established within five years in the district of one
of the viceroys.</p>

<p>Municipal ownership presents another phase of this subject; a century
ago comparatively few cities in this country or Europe owned
their own waterworks; now it is the exception that any city of any
size relies upon a private corporation for its water supply. City
lighting is having the same history, although municipalization began
later with lighting plants than with waterworks. Now comes the
question of street car lines, and, as the same principles apply, the same
inevitable trend toward municipal ownership is noticeable. The experience
of all the cities has been practically the same; first, liberal franchises
to induce the establishment of water, light or street car plants;
second, efforts at regulation and restriction, made futile by the corrupt
influence of the franchise companies; third, municipal ownership as
a protection to the people and as a means of purifying politics. In
the extent to which municipal ownership has been carried Great
Britain leads the world, although in other countries some cities like
Vienna have rivaled the cities of Great Britain.</p>

<p>In nearly all of the countries of Europe and Asia the telegraph
lines are now owned by the government, and in most of the cities
the telephone system is also owned by the public. It is hardly necessary
to say that in all countries of any standing the mail service is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
now in the hands of the government. There is very noticeable growth
in the government ownership of railroads. Many years ago the government
ownership of railroads was tested in various European nations
and the tendency toward the extension of government mileage and
the diminution of the mileage of privately owned roads has been constant.
In some countries there is still competition between the government
lines and the lines owned by private corporations, but
experience leaves no doubt that the lines owned by the government
will ultimately supplant the roads in private hands. Switzerland has
within four years purchased the main railroad system within her
territory; Japan has within a year extended the government railroads
by purchasing some of the roads formerly in private hands, and the
Indian government is planning to absorb more of the privately owned
lines. In France a number of the railroads hold fifty-year charters,
which have now more than half expired, and which provide for the
surrender of the lines to the government at the end of that period&mdash;the
government in the meantime guaranteeing a fixed interest and an
annual contribution to the sinking fund. It is not fair to compare the
government railroads of Europe with the private railroads of America.
The conditions are quite different. The comparison should be made
between the government and private in the same country. Experience
has shown that in the United States municipal plants furnish
better and cheaper service than private plants.</p>

<p>While local considerations and local conditions have much to do in
the determination of each case, there is one general principle which
is becoming more and more clearly outlined as the question of government
ownership is discussed, namely, that when a monopoly
becomes necessary it must be a government monopoly and not a
monopoly in private hands. In other words, the principle now most
familiarly applied is, "competition where competition is possible; government
monopoly where competition is impossible." I have not space
for the discussion of details; many different methods have been employed
in different countries for the acquiring of private plants by the
city or state, and different methods have been employed in different
countries for the elimination of the political element from public
service. Those who have faith in the intelligence and capacity
of the people have confidence that they will be able to reduce to a
minimum any dangers attendant upon a course which they believe
to be necessary to their own welfare. The fact that after more than
a quarter of a century of experience no retrograde movement is to be
observed furnishes some proof that the dangers anticipated have not
been shown to be insurmountable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span></p>

<p>Another world problem is to be found in the effort to fix woman's
place in the social economy. No one can travel around the world
without noting the wide difference that exists between the treatment
of woman in different countries. In the Orient she has, until comparatively
recent years, occupied a very inferior position. In no
respect has the influence of the west upon the east been more marked
than in the elevation of woman. Even in Japan, where for half a
century the ideas of America and Europe have found vigorous growth,
woman's position is not yet equal to man's. The education of boys
received attention before the education of the girls, but the girls'
schools are now multiplying in number and in attendance. Traveling
in the country one still sees the blackened teeth, it formerly having
been regarded as the proper thing for a woman to make her teeth black
after marriage, but among the young generation the custom is
unknown. In China woman has not only lagged behind man in education,
but she has been subjected to a torture known as foot-binding
which is to be found nowhere else. Societies are now being formed
to discourage the practice, but it is sad to learn how slowly this reform
has grown. In both Japan and China plural marriage, or what has
been equivalent to plural marriage, has been common. The man has
been allowed to take unto himself as many wives as he could support
without asking the consent of former wives&mdash;a practice which seems
strange to those who have been brought up to regard the marriage
vows as mutually binding and to consider man and woman as standing
upon an equal plane when entering upon the relation of husband
and wife.</p>

<p>In India child marriage is one of the worst customs that has afflicted
these unhappy people. Girls have been given in marriage when only
nine or ten years old, and a widow of twelve or thirteen is not unusual.
Remarriage of widows is not permitted under Hindu custom, suttee,
or the burning of the widow, formerly being regarded as the proper
thing. In both India and Arabia the women are still veiled and
excluded from the society of men. It is difficult to estimate the loss
that has come to society from the failure to recognize the mutual
stimulus which man and woman find in co-operation in the work
of civilization.</p>

<p>Even in Europe woman's position is not as good as it is in the
United States, although in the Christian countries her rights are more
respected and her good influence more appreciated. Max O'Rell, the
witty French lecturer, used to say that if he was going to be born a
woman he would pray to be born in the United States. It was a
happy expression, for surely there is no other country in which so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
high an estimate is placed upon woman or where she more fully
shares in both the joys and responsibilities of life. For the superiority
of her position she has Christianity and education to thank; Christianity
has ever recognized woman's equality with man and education
has fitted her to be a real helpmate in life.</p>

<p>A third question which one meets everywhere is the labor question.
In Europe it is a question between labor and capital and the laborer
is organizing for the advancement of his welfare. The guild and the
labor organization have long sought to enlarge the laborer's share of
the joint profit of labor and capital and to improve the conditions
which form his environment. The efforts of these societies have
mainly been directed, first, toward the improvement of sanitary conditions;
second, toward the shortening of hours; and, third, toward
an increase in wages. It looks like a reflection on mankind in general
to say that laboring men should have to ask legislation to protect their
lives while at work. It would seem that employers would of their
own accord regard the safety and the health of employes as of paramount
importance, and yet it has been necessary even in the United
States to compel the building of air-shafts in mines and to force the
use of safety appliances on railroads and street car lines, and in the
operation of machinery. Still more strange is it that it should be
necessary to fix a minimum age at which children can be employed.
The very sight of little boys and girls working in factories at the
expense of their physical growth and their mental development is so
revolting that one can hardly understand how such legislation can
be necessary, and yet throughout Europe and the United States laboring
men through their organizations have been compelled to fight
for the protection of the children of the poor. In Asia the inauguration
of factories has not yet been followed by the protection of the
children.</p>

<p>Reforms advance in groups. It is seldom that one real reform is
achieved alone, so the limitation of hours of labor has, as a rule,
accompanied legislation for the protection of children and for the
improvement of sanitary conditions in mines and workshops. Those
who now enjoy an eight-hour day can remember the nine-hour day
and the ten-hour day, but can hardly recall the days of twelve or
fourteen hours. In the factories that are starting up in the Orient
long hours are the rule, and with long hours there is the attendant
degradation of the toiler. The demand for the eight-hour day is an
international one and the laboring man is gradually winning his
fight, partly by an appeal to conscience and partly by proof that the
highest efficiency is inconsistent with long hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span></p>

<p>In the raising of wages two factors have been at work&mdash;the labor
organization and the higher efficiency that has come with more universal
education. The educated workman can earn more than the
ignorant one and he soon demands a compensation commensurate
with his services.</p>

<p>The labor saving machine, too, has played no unimportant part in
increasing the workman's compensation. It has raised the quality of
the work done and has brought into use a higher grade of skill than
was formerly employed. While the labor saving machine is by some
regarded as antagonistic to the welfare of the laborer, no farsighted
observer can fail to note that it has increased rather than diminished
the number employed at the work into which it has been introduced,
while it has developed a higher skill which, in turn, has secured a
higher compensation. The handling of a railroad locomotive requires
more skill than the handling of a freight team, and the engineer commands
higher wages than the teamster. The railroad by vastly increasing
commerce has multiplied the number of persons engaged in the
handling of passengers and freight, and it has at the same time
improved the character of the work done and raised the intellectual
standard of those employed. The same result has followed in other
kinds of work. It might be stated thus: labor saving machinery,
as it is called&mdash;although it might more properly be called labor-multiplying
machinery&mdash;has created a demand for a higher grade of
labor; universal education has supplied this demand, and the labor
organization has secured for these higher grade laborers larger compensation
and more favorable conditions.</p>

<p>One thought has grown upon me as we have traveled, namely, the
dignity of labor. In no other country is so high an estimate placed
upon the wage-earner as in this country. In the Orient there was,
until the advent of western ideas, an impassable gulf between the
prince and his people, and there is even now in a large part of Asia
a gulf so wide that one who toils with his hands cannot look across
it. The royal families have lived by the sword and they have forced
from those beneath them a tribute sufficient to support themselves
and their armed retainers. The masses have been the prey of the
governing classes, no matter what tribe or family held the throne.</p>

<p>In Europe the extremes of society have been brought nearer together,
although there is still a gap between the aristocracy and the masses.
This gap, however, is constantly decreasing, education and popular
government being the most influential factors in bringing about this
result. With education now more and more within the reach of all,
the poor boy is forcing his way to the front in business, and with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
fortune thus acquired he is leveling rank. In the political world,
too, the champion of the weak and the oppressed is making his influence
felt and his political power is opening before him doors which
until recently were closed. In France deputies, senators and even
presidents have come up from the people, and in England a labor
leader, John Burns, has fought his way into the cabinet. Who will
say that the European laboring man is not making progress when
labor's foremost representative in Great Britain becomes the guest of
the king?</p>

<p>Yes, America leads the world in recognition of the true worth of
the man who toils, and yet even in America there is room for still
further advancement. Our national life is full of instances of men
who have risen from office boy to merchant prince, from plowman to
governor, congressman and senator; we have had a rail-splitter made
president&mdash;and no president ever bore himself better or served amid
more trying times&mdash;while another president could recall the days
when he followed the towpath on a canal. And yet, with these
illustrious examples of poverty overcome and great careers built upon
a foundation of manual labor, there is still much to be done before
the producer of wealth will receive the consideration which he
deserves. The dignity of labor will not be appreciated as it ought to
be until our young men are taught that it is more honorable to contribute
by labor to the sum of the world's wealth than to spend in
idleness the money that others have made.</p>

<p>Tolstoy contends that people cannot be kept in sympathy with
each other unless all perform some physical labor throughout their
lives; he says that contempt for those who do the drudgery of life is
natural if we put that drudgery upon others and reserve for ourselves
only intellectual pursuits. Whether this be true or not, it is true
that we cannot view labor in its proper relation to life unless we
measure life by a standard different from that which is now ordinarily
applied. So long as we measure life by its income rather than by its
outgo, we shall seek those occupations which yield the largest pecuniary
reward; when we measure life by what we put into the world
rather than what we take out of it, we shall seek those occupations
which offer the largest field of usefulness.</p>

<p>Enough has been said to indicate that the world's work is broad
enough to enlist all who are willing to work and that the variety is
sufficient to allow each to follow his taste and select his field, provided
only that he is actuated by a purpose to render to society a service
which will be more than an equivalent for all that society has done
for him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLVI.</h2>

<h3>A STUDY OF GOVERNMENTS.</h3>


<p>One who travels in foreign lands is likely to learn but little of the
governments of the lands through which he passes, unless he makes
a special effort to inform himself, for the lines of travel are laid
through the communities where law and order are maintained and
where the government is so stable that the casual observer has no
occasion to investigate its inner workings. The mountains tower
above him, and he sees them; the chasms yawn before him and
he beholds them; and the various forms of agriculture leave
a panoramic effect upon his memory. He frequently meets the merchant
in his store, sees the laborer at his work quite often, and occasionally
beholds a grandee in his carriage; but not being able to speak
the language of the country he learns little about the forms of government
and less about the political aspirations of the people; and yet the
science of government is one of the most important sciences, and the
"royal art," as it has been called, stands first among the arts. Tolstoy
has declared that the science which teaches us how to live is the most
important of sciences, and surely the science of government comes
next. While it is true that an individual can by misbehavior forfeit
the blessings of good government, or by good behavior minimize the
evils of bad government&mdash;while it is true that no government, however
good, can save a man from himself if he is determined to throw himself
away, and that no government, however bad, can entirely deprive
him of the rewards of virtue, yet governments may do much to encourage
or to hinder the development of the people.</p>

<p>Governments may retard or advance the material growth of a country.
For instance, our government is in part, at least, responsible for
the unparalleled development of the United States, because it has
given the largest encouragement to the individual. The Japanese
government has in like manner stimulated education by the establishment
of a public school system and has developed a large number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
of public men by the organization of a parliamentary system. Turkey,
on the other hand, has blighted some of the fairest portions of
the earth by suppressing political independence, by ignoring education,
and by leaving the industrious citizen at the mercy of the
marauder. There has been little political life in Turkey because few
of the people have had the education necessary to take a broad survey
of the country and its needs, while great stretches of fertile country lie
uncultivated because the government is so indifferent to the rights of
the people that the tiller of the soil has no assurance that he will be
allowed to harvest the crop which he plants. Those who have investigated
the subject contend that the valley of the Jordan would be a
fruitful region if protection were given to those who would cultivate
it, but because the Bedouin has been allowed to come down from the
hillside and reap where he has not sown, the land is neglected.</p>

<p>In a trip around the globe one sees in actual working every form
of government known to man. In Russia, an unlimited monarchy
until recently laid its oppressive hand upon more than a hundred
millions of human beings. They held their lives, their liberty and
their property at the will of the ruler. Any citizen in the czar's vast
domains could be taken from his home and exiled for life without his
or his family knowing the cause of his punishment. The royal family
and the officeholders held the people in contempt and denied even
the natural rights of men. The people were taught to be thankful
for any favors, however small, that the "Little Father" saw fit to
bestow, and they were likewise taught that it was dangerous to complain
even when the most fundamental right was ignored. Now there
is a duma, and the duma as an institution still lives. No one can
predict through what trials and tribulations the country may yet pass,
but constitutional government will yet be hers. As in the winter time
we cannot foresee or foretell what days will be pleasant and what days
stormy, but do know that in a few months we shall have summer, so
without being able to determine through what tumults or riots or
revolutions Russia must pass, we know that in a few years she will
have a stable government in which her people will have a voice.</p>

<p>In Japan the government is somewhat mixed in its form. She has
a parliament, but the executive branch of the government is not yet
in the hands of the people. The tendency in Japan, as everywhere, is
toward further limitation of the power of the sovereign and further enlargement
of the power of the people. The vital political question there
now is whether the emperor shall select his advisers from among his personal
friends or from the members of the party which dominates the
parliament. There is, of course, no doubt of the ultimate triumph of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
the parliamentary party. Denmark witnessed a similar struggle which
lasted for nearly a generation and terminated, as such struggles always
do, in the triumph of the parliament.</p>

<p>In China they have a mixture of monarchy and aristocracy. The
monarch is unlimited in his power, but he is so hedged about by the
aristocracy that he really has very little independence. Like some
of the native princes who rule under Dutch regents, the Chinese ruler
is the servant rather than the master of his officials. Living in the
forbidden city and meeting personally but few of his people, he is
quite dependent upon the mandarins. The aristocracy of China is not
an aristocracy of birth or of wealth, but a civil service aristocracy.
While positions are often bought&mdash;sometimes even sold at auction
when the emperor needs money&mdash;yet, as a rule, the civil servants of
China are selected by examination. These systems, while so antiquated
that they have been recently very materially modified, were
intended to be fair as between applicants. The course of study was
not comprehensive, and the tests applied gave but little idea of one's
fitness for office. These men, once in power, were the rulers in all
local affairs, and the higher officials were influential in all matters
of state, and yet, in spite of this system&mdash;or because of it, whichever
the reader will have it&mdash;China slumbered while the nations around
awakened. The fact that the appointees to the civil service had to go
through certain routine examinations prescribed by those who had
already passed through the same routine, kept the service in a rut, and
as it was not necessary that the appointees should be interested in
anyone but themselves, they showed no concern about the people
from whom they drew their salaries. It was a system calculated to
develop the selfishness which seemed an inherent part of Chinese life
and philosophy. Now that the school examinations have been substituted
for the civil service examinations an improvement may be
expected in the service, but even the modified system will not keep
the servant in touch with those whom he serves.</p>

<p>In Europe the constitutional monarchy has undergone a constant
development until in many countries the king is but a figurehead.
In England the sovereign would not think of vetoing a bill passed by
the legislative body, and the House of Lords seldom vetoes a bill
passed by the House of Commons. The prime minister is a much
more potent factor in government than the king himself. In Norway
the government is brought even nearer to the people by the substitution
of one legislative body for two, that body being elected by the
people under universal suffrage. The king of Norway is even less
likely to attempt to obstruct the will of parliament than the king of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
England. Norway has reduced monarchy to a minimum and placed
the government in the hands of the voters to do with it as they please.</p>

<p>In Switzerland the republican form of government has stood the
test of experiment. In the absence of pomp, ceremony and official
extravagance the government of Switzerland is not surpassed, if
equaled, by the government of any similar population in the world.
Three languages are spoken within her borders and used in parliamentary
proceedings. Part of her people are Protestant, part Catholic
and part Jew, and yet, with the initiative and the referendum in
both the federal government and the cantons, the government rests so
securely upon popular will that the people live together in entire
harmony and could resist a much larger population attacking from
without.</p>

<p>The colonial system also comes under one's observation in a trip
around the world. The Netherlands have large colonial possessions
in the Malay archipelago, but they have been compelled to abandon
the culture system&mdash;a form of slavery&mdash;and there are signs of a political
development which will some day make it necessary for Holland
to consult the wishes of the people more than she has in the past.</p>

<p>I have already spoken of both India and Egypt in other articles,
and I only refer to the subject here in order to draw a contrast between
colonialism as applied to Canada and colonialism as it is seen in India.
In Canada the people have as complete self-government as they have
in England, the governor-general being as little likely to use the veto
power as the king himself. In India, on the other hand, the natives
are not consulted in regard to the general government. Taxes are
levied and collected, armies are raised, fed and directed without regard
to the wishes of the native population. They have experienced all
of the evils that can come from a colonial system administered by a
trading company, and they have had a chance to learn that a colonial
system, even when administered in such a way as to command the
admiration of those who believe in colonialism, still falls far short
of self-government. I have already said that we have treated the
Filipinos better than England has treated the people of India, but
that we have done so at an enormous expense to our country. It
would be better for the Filipinos and better for us to recognize their
right to self-government and independence.</p>

<p>After one has had a chance to see monarchies, limited and unlimited,
aristocracies based upon birth and aristocracies based upon a
merit system; and after one has had a chance to compare these systems
with the republican form of government, he is ready to declare
that from every standpoint that government is best which rests upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
the consent of the governed. Some have insisted that a monarchy
is stronger because all of the power of the government can be concentrated
quickly and made effective at once, but this advantage is small
when compared with the advantages to be derived from a government
which the people support with enthusiasm. The historian, Bancroft,
rightly declares that a republic ought to be the strongest of all governments
because, "discarding the implements of terror, it dares to
build its citadel in the hearts of men."</p>

<p>A republic which is, not merely in theory but in fact, "a government
of the people, by the people and for the people," is the most enduring
of governments. It is strong because it is loved and loved because
it is good.</p>

<p>Aristocracies are defended by their advocates on the ground that
a few are wiser than the many, but this is not true, whether it is an
aristocracy of birth or of learning, for as the whole is greater than
any of its parts, so a democracy must be wiser than an aristocracy
because it can draw upon the wisdom of all. The old saying, that
"everybody knows more than anybody," is founded upon reason and
experience, but there is another reason why a democracy is better
than an aristocracy, namely, that the interests of the whole people
are safer in the hands of the people themselves than in the hands of
any element which assumes to speak for the people. The faults of
free government have been found to be, not in the people themselves,
but in those who, selected to represent them, betray their trust. If
the representatives of the people whom the people themselves select
are sometimes unfaithful to their trust, what must be expected of
those who assume to act without being selected by the people?</p>

<p>In aristocracies resting upon birth the very fact that the rulers
regard themselves as superior to the masses makes it difficult for them
to view questions from the standpoint of the people at large. Whatever
the form of the government, there will always be, as Jefferson
declared, two parties, one tending toward democracy and the other
tending toward aristocracy. Those who have faith in the people are
constantly trying to make the government more and more responsive
to the will of the people; those who distrust the people are constantly
endeavoring to increase the distance between the citizen and his representative.
In a republic there are some who emphasize the virtues
of the people and others who emphasize the virtues of the representative.
Some insist that the people should think for themselves and
elect representatives to give expression to the public will; others insist
that the representatives should be so superior to the masses as to be
able to do the thinking for the people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span></p>

<p>In the early history of this country Thomas Jefferson and Alexander
Hamilton represented these two ideas. Jefferson not only believed
that the people should think for themselves and should elect their
representatives, but he believed in short terms and frequent elections
in order that the citizens might more effectively control their public
servants. Hamilton, on the other hand, believed in a strong centralized
government in which the officials should be removed as far as
possible from the voter. His plan of government, carefully prepared
and presented at the time of the formation of the constitution, provided
for a president and senators elected for life or during good
behavior, and for governors of the several states appointed by the
general government for life or during good behavior. No one would
propose such a plan at this time, so great has been the advance toward
democracy. This growth is indicated by the fact that the national
house of representatives has four times declared in favor of the election
of the United States senators by direct vote of the people and by the
further fact that more than two-thirds of the states of the union have
by legislative action declared in favor of this change. The unpopularity
of the latter part of Hamilton's plan, namely, the appointment of
governors by the general government, is shown by the fact that territorial
government under which the governors are appointed by the
president, not for life, but for a few years, is deemed unsatisfactory.
The people of a territory are always wanting statehood, and the main
reason is that they desire to elect their own officials.</p>

<p>The democratic idea is growing&mdash;the term is not used in a partisan
sense, but in that broader sense in which it describes government
by the people. There is not a civilized nation in which the idea of
popular government is not growing, and in all the semi-civilized
nations there are reformers who are urging an extension of the influence
of the people in government. So universal is this growth
of democratic ideas that there can be no doubt of their final
triumph. Monarchies, at first unlimited, are now limited, and
limited monarchies are recognizing more and more the right of
the people to a voice in their own government. Monarchies and
aristocracies tend toward democracy, and republics tend to become
more and more democratic in their forms and methods.</p>

<p>When the seed, planted in the earth, sends forth the tender leaf and
then the stalk; when the grain appears upon the stalk and supplies
the bread necessary for the support of our bodies, we know that there
is back of the seed a force irresistible and constantly working. As
irresistible and as ceaseless in its activity is the force behind political
and moral truth. The advocates of the American theory of government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
can, therefore, labor with the confident assurance that the
principles planted upon American soil a century and a quarter ago
are destined to grow here and everywhere until arbitrary power will
nowhere be known, and, until the voice of the people shall be recognized,
if not as the voice of God, at least, as Bancroft defines it, as the
best expression of the divine will to be found upon the earth.</p>

<p>In republics, as in other forms of government, there will at times
be disturbances, but these come from a failure to recognize and respect
the current of public opinion. If we stand by the side of a stream
and watch it glide past us, we can in safety listen to the song of the
waters, but if we attempt to dam the stream we find the water rising
above the dam. If we make the dam higher still, the water rises still
more, and at last the force in the obstructed water is so great that
no dam made by human hands can longer stay it. Sometimes, when
the dam is washed away, damage is done to those who live in the
valley below, but the fault is not in the stream, but in those who
attempt to obstruct it. So in human society there is a current of
public opinion which flows ever onward. If left to have its way it
does not harm anyone, but if obstructed, this current may become a
menace. At last the obstruction must yield to the force of the current.
In monarchies and aristocracies the dam is sometimes built so high
that it is removed by force, but in republics the ballot can be relied
upon to keep the channel of the stream open, or if obstruction is
attempted, to remove it while yet it can be removed with safety. The
advantage of a republic is that the people, through their representatives,
are able to give public opinion free play, and the more democratic
a republic is, the more nearly does it conform to the wishes of
the people.</p>

<p>No one can study the governments of the old world without a feeling
of gratitude that in the new world the science of government has
been carried to its highest point, and we of the United States can
rejoice that our nation leads the world in recognizing the right of the
people to devise and to direct the government under which they are
to work out their destiny.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLVII.</h2>

<h3>THE TARIFF DEBATE IN ENGLAND.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></h3>


<p>An American feels at home in England just now, for he constantly
reads in the newspapers and hears on the streets the tariff arguments
so familiar in the United States. I can almost imagine myself in the
midst of a presidential campaign, with import duties as the only issue.
I have been especially fortunate in arriving here at the very height
of the discussion and I have been privileged to hear the best speakers
on both sides. Hon. Joseph Chamberlain, late secretary for the colonies,
left the cabinet some three months ago in order to present to
the country the tariff policy which he believed to be necessary. Not
desiring to make the government responsible for the proposition put
forth by him, he turned his official duties over to another and has
been conducting one of the most remarkable campaigns that England
has seen in recent years.</p>

<p>He enters the fight with a number of things to his credit. He is a
great orator, he is pleasing in manner, experienced in debate, skillful
in the arraignment of his adversaries, and possesses the faculty
of so holding the attention of his hearers as to make them eager to
catch the next sentence. He is not an impassioned speaker, he has
no grand climaxes that overwhelm an audience, but he does have
what his friends call a "restrained eloquence" that leaves the impression
that he never quite reaches the limit of his powers. He is a
man who would rank high in any land and as an antagonist he would
not fear to meet the best on any platform.</p>

<p>He is about five feet nine or ten inches in height and weighs about
175 pounds. He wears no beard and is impressive in appearance.
The cartoonists take liberties with him as with other public men, and
I may say in passing that there are some newspaper cartoonists over
here who do excellent work.</p>

<p>Mr. Chamberlain is urging a departure from the free trade policy
which England has followed for fifty years, and he defends his position
on three grounds:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span></p>

<p>First&mdash;That it is needed for the protection of English manufacturers
and English laborers.</p>

<p>Second&mdash;That it is necessary for the defense and strengthening of
the empire.</p>

<p>Third&mdash;That a tariff can be used when necessary as a retaliatory
weapon to make a breach in the tariff walls that other nations have
erected.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="statesmen" id="statesmen"></a>
<img src="images/ill221.jpg" width="450" height="383" alt="statesmen" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HENRY ASQUITH.</p>

<p class="center">DUKE OF DEVONSHIRE.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD ROSEBERY.</p>
</div></div>

<p>In presenting the first proposition he employs the usual protectionist
arguments. He appeals to particular industries and promises better
wages to labor and more constant employment. He complains that
foreign products are being "dumped" in England. The foreigner is
accused of selling his surplus wares here without profit or below cost
while he sells for enough at home to enable him to carry on his
business.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span></p>

<p>I heard Mr. Chamberlain's speech at Cardiff, the chief city of
Wales. It was an audience largely made up of wage-earners, and his
appeals were adroit and elicited an enthusiastic response. He dwelt
at length on the tin industry; figured the growth of the industry from
1882 to 1892 and showed that during the next decade the tin industry
had suffered by the establishment of tin plate mills in the United
States.</p>

<p>He assumed that if the English government had been authorized
to make reciprocal treaties it might have persuaded the United States
to forego the protection of tin plate in exchange for trade advantages
in some other direction. He estimated the loss that had come to
Welsh workmen because of the lessened demand for their tin plate,
and he contended that it was necessary to give preferential treatment
to the colonies in order to increase or even to hold their attachment
to the empire.</p>

<p>In discussing retaliation, he seemed to assume what the protectionists
of the United States have often declared, namely, that the foreigner
pays the tax; and his argument was that England ought to
tax the goods coming in from other countries if other countries taxed
goods imported from England. He has coined phrases that are going
the rounds of the press, the most popular of which is embodied in the
question, "If another nation strikes you with a tariff tax, are you
going to take it lying down?" This phrase aroused a spirit of pugnacity
at Cardiff and was enthusiastically applauded.</p>

<p>In presenting the claims of the empire, Mr. Chamberlain occupies
much the same position as the American protectionist who contends
that a tariff wall makes our own country independent of other nations.
In presenting this argument the late colonial secretary has the advantage
of the great popularity which he won during the South African
war, the spirit of empire being just now quite strong in England.</p>

<p>So much for the leader of the tariff reform movement, for, strange
as it may seem, the English crusade for the adoption of a tariff is being
conducted through the Tariff Reform League, which, with Mr.
Chamberlain's endorsement, is asking for a campaign fund of
$500,000.</p>

<p>On the other side are, first, the conservatism that supports the settled
policy of half a century; second, the political and economic arguments
which weigh against a protective tariff, and, third, the
ability and personal influence of the men who are arrayed against
Mr. Chamberlain. I have attended a number of meetings of the opposition.
The first was at St. Neots, Huntingtonshire, where I heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
Mr. H. H. Asquith, one of the Liberal leaders in parliament. He is
of about the same height as Mr. Chamberlain, but heavier, his face
and shoulders being considerably broader. Mr. Asquith differs very
materially from Mr. Chamberlain in his style of oratory, but is a
master in his line. His is more the argument of the lawyer. He is
more logical and a closer reasoner. He is regarded as one of the
ablest public men in England, and after listening to him for an hour
I could easily believe his reputation to be well earned.</p>

<p>While he discussed with thoroughness all phases of the fiscal question,
I was most impressed with his reply to what may be called the
imperial part of Mr. Chamberlain's argument. He insisted that preferential
duties would weaken instead of strengthen the bonds that
unite England to her colonies, because partiality could not be shown
to one industry without discrimination against the other industries,
and he warned the advocates of protection not to divide the people
of the colonies and the people of the home country into warring factions,
and suggested that when these factions were arrayed against
each other in a contest for legislative advantage, the harmony of the
nation would be disturbed and ill-will between the various sections,
elements and industries engendered.</p>

<p>At a house dinner of the National Liberal club in London I heard
another member of parliament, Mr. R. S. Robson, a Liberal, who
took retaliation for his subject. Mr. Robson presented a clear, comprehensive
and concise analysis of the policy of retaliation; the strongest
points made by him being, first, that retaliation meant commercial
war, and, second, that it contemplated a permanent policy of
protection. He pointed out that no country had ever aimed a retaliatory
tariff at England; that tariffs in other countries were laid for
domestic purposes and not out of antagonism to another country. He
contended that other countries, instead of modifying their tariffs because
of attempted retaliation on the part of England, would be more
likely excited to an unfriendliness which they had not before shown,
and that if England were the aggressor in such a tariff war she must
necessarily be a large loser. He said that it was impossible to conceive
of concessions being secured by a threat to raise a tariff wall in
England. It would be necessary, he contended, if a retaliatory policy
was undertaken to first impose a high tariff all around and then
offer to reduce it in special cases. This would be a radical departure
from the policy of free trade and would bring with it all the evils that
had led to the abandonment of a protective policy under the leadership
of Cobden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides the Liberal opposition, Mr. Chamberlain has to meet the
antagonism of a number of influential leaders who would indorse Mr.
Balfour if he only proposed retaliation in a particular case where an
open and grievous blow had been struck at England, but who are not
willing to join Mr. Chamberlain in advocating a return to a protective
policy.</p>

<p>I attended a great meeting held under the auspices of the Free Food
League and heard speeches delivered by the Duke of Devonshire and
Lord Goshen. I was told that the duke was the only English statesman
who ever took a nap during the progress of his own speech. Thus
forewarned, I was prepared for a season of rest, but the duke surprised
his friends (and they are many) on this occasion and his
speech has been the talk of the country. It was a powerful arraignment
of the proposed tax on food, and, taking into consideration the
high standing and great prestige of the duke, will exert a widespread
influence on the decision of the controversy. The duke is a
tall, strongly built man, with a long head and full sandy beard
sprinkled with gray. He speaks with deliberation and emphasis, but
lacks the graces of the other orators whom I had an opportunity to
hear. If, however, ease and grace were wanting, the tremendous effectiveness
of the pile driver and the battering ram make up for them.</p>

<p>He denounced the proposition to put a tax upon the people's food
as a blow to the welfare and greatness of the nation. He scouted the
idea that the tax would not ultimately extend to all food or that it
would not raise the price of food and showed that the increase in the
cost of food and clothing would take from the laboring man any advantage
which Mr. Chamberlain promised to bring by his protective
policy.</p>

<p>At the Free Food meeting the duke was followed by Lord Goshen,
a conspicuous leader of the unionist party. Though now about seventy
years old, he possesses great vitality and entered into the discussion
with an earnestness that bespeaks the extraordinary power of the
man. In appearance he reminded me of Gladstone and of Paul Kruger.
I should say that his face had some of the characteristics of both&mdash;rugged
in its outlines and giving an impression of courage and
strength combined with great intellect. He replied to Mr. Chamberlain's
challenge, "Will you take it lying down?" with the question,
"Will you hide behind a wall?" He denied that it was necessary
for the Briton to build a barricade and conceal himself behind it.</p>

<p>In reply to the argument that the Englishman needed protection
from the foreigner, he gave statistics to show that Germany, one of
the protected countries to which Mr. Chamberlain constantly refers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
had an increasing number of the unemployed. His reference to the
increased consumption of horse meat in Germany and the decrease
in the consumption of other kinds of meat met with a response that
seems likely to make "No horse meat" a slogan in the campaign.</p>

<p>The last meeting which I attended was that at which Lord Rosebery
made his reply to Mr. Chamberlain. Lord Rosebery meets Mr. Chamberlain
on an equal footing. He is about the same height, but a
trifle stouter. He is an orator of great distinction, graceful, polished,
of wide learning and great experience, and he possesses a wit that
enables him to keep his audience in constant good humor. He has
been prime minister and enjoys great popularity. His reception at
the Surrey theatre, South London, was as cordial as Mr. Chamberlain's
reception at Cardiff. With all the arts of the orator he repelled
the attacks of Mr. Chamberlain and arraigned the policy of the conservatives.
He denied that there was any excuse, to use his words,
for the "lamentations of the modern Jeremiah." His lordship declared
that the country had made great progress under the policy of
free commerce with the world and that England had the world for
her granary and depicted the possible consequences if she attempted
to wage war against those who furnished her bread and meat.</p>

<p>He declared that the colonies could not supply the food that the
people of England needed, but called Mr. Chamberlain's attention
to the fact that Canada was "dumping" more iron into England than
any of the protected countries complained of. He arraigned the conservative
government's large and increasing expenditures and suggested
that the government might better lessen the taxes upon the
people than impose new taxes upon their food and clothing.</p>

<p>He closed with an appeal for more technical instruction; for a better
understanding of the needs of their customers, and for a more
earnest effort for the physical, intellectual and moral advancement
of the people.</p>

<p>I will not attempt to predict the outcome of this fiscal controversy.
I have missed my guess on a similar controversy in the United States
and I shall not venture a prophecy in a foreign land. Mr. Chamberlain's
opponents believe that a return to protection would be taken
as renunciation of England's ambition to be "mistress of the seas,"
and that it would presage commercial isolation. It is a battle of
giants over a great question and all the world is interested in the
result.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLVIII.</h2>

<h3>IRELAND AND HER LEADERS.</h3>


<p>November 29th was spent in Dublin, the 30th at Belfast and en route
to that city from Dublin. Dublin is a very substantial looking city and
much more ancient in appearance than Belfast, the latter reminding
one more of an enterprising American city. We did not have a chance
to visit any of the industries of Dublin, and only a linen factory and
a shipyard in Belfast, but as the linen factory, the York Street Linen
Mills, was one of the largest in Ireland, and the shipyard, Harland
&amp; Wolff's, the largest in the world, they gave some idea of the industrial
possibilities of the island.</p>

<p>The lord mayor of Belfast, Sir Daniel Dixon, gave us a history of
the municipal undertakings and extended to us every possible courtesy.
To one accustomed to the farms of the Mississippi and the Missouri
valleys, the little farms of Ireland seem contracted indeed, but what
they lack in size they make up in thoroughness of cultivation. Not
a foot seemed to be wasted. At Birmingham I saw some Kerry cows,
which I can best describe as pony cattle, that they told me were being
bred in Ireland in preference to the larger breeds; they are certainly
more in keeping with the size of the farms. The farm houses are not
large, but from the railroad train they looked neat and well kept.</p>

<p>My visit to Ireland was too brief to enable me to look into the condition
of the tenants in the various parts of the island, but by the
courtesy of the lord mayor of Dublin, Mr. Timothy Harrington, and
Mr. John Dillon, both members of parliament, I met a number of
the prominent representatives of Ireland in national politics. A luncheon
at the Mansion House was attended by some 75 of the Irish leaders,
including Archbishop Walsh, John Redmond, John Dillon, Michael
Davitt, William Field, Patrick O'Brien, several members of the city
council, ex-Mayor Valentine Dillon, High Sheriff Thomas Powers,
and Drs. McArdle and Cox, and other persons distinguished in various
walks of life.</p>

<p>The dinner at Mr. Dillon's gave me a chance to meet Mr. Bailey
of the new land commission, and Mr. Finucane, lately connected with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a><br /><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
the Indian department, and to become better acquainted with the
more prominent of the Irish leaders whose names have become familiar
to American readers, and whom I met at luncheon.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 398px;"><a name="patriots" id="patriots"></a>
<img src="images/ill222.jpg" width="398" height="600" alt="patriots" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">T. P. O'CONNOR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MR. MICHAEL DAVITT<br />

MR. JOHN DILLON&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MR. JOHN E. REDMOND
</p></div>
</div>

<p>Archbishop Walsh is one of the best known and most beloved of
the Irish clergy, and he endeared himself to the friends of bimetallism
throughout the world by the pamphlet which he wrote some years
ago, setting forth the effect of the gold standard upon the Irish tenant
farmer. It was a genuine pleasure to make his personal acquaintance.
It may be added, in passing, that the tenants of Ireland will be more
than ever interested in the stable dollar when they have secured title
to their lands and assumed the payments which extend over more
than sixty years. Any increase in the value of the dollar would
increase the burden of these payments by lessening the price which
they would obtain for the products of the soil.</p>

<p>Mr. John Redmond is the leader of the Irish party in parliament,
and, having visited the United States, is personally known to many
of our people. He has the appearance of a well-to-do lawyer, is quick
to catch a point, ready of speech and immensely popular with his
people. He has the reputation of being one of the most forcible of the
Irish orators, and I regret that I had no opportunity of hearing him
speak.</p>

<p>Mr. Dillon is a tall man, probably six feet one, with a scholarly face
and wears a beard. His long experience in parliament, his thorough
knowledge of the issues of the last quarter of a century, and his fidelity
to the interests of the people of his land have given him a deservedly
high place among the great Irishmen of the present generation.</p>

<p>Mr. Michael Davitt has also had a conspicuous career, but is not
now in parliament, having resigned as a protest against the Boer
war. He is the oldest of the group and shows in his countenance the
fighting qualities that have made his name known throughout the
world. He is not a diplomat&mdash;he has not learned the language of
the court. He is not a compromiser, but a combatant, and his blows
have been telling ones.</p>

<p>The lord mayor of Dublin, Mr. Timothy Harrington, has been honored
with a third election as lord mayor, a position first held by
Daniel O'Connell, but he is always at Westminster whenever there is
an important vote in parliament. He is a typical Irishman, good-natured,
full of humor, well informed and a natural politician.</p>

<p>At a dinner given a few days later at the National Liberal club in
London by Mr. T. P. O'Connor, I met several other Irish members,
among them Mr. William Redmond, brother of the leader of the Irish
party, and himself a man of great ability and long parliamentary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
experience, and James Devlin, one of the most brilliant of the orators
of the younger generation. The oldest person at the O'Connor dinner
was Mr. O'Brien, the last Irishman who enjoyed the distinction of
being sentenced to be hung, drawn and quartered. The host, Mr.
O'Connor, while he represents a Liverpool constituency and is not,
therefore, technically speaking, a member of the Irish party, is one
of the most prominent and influential of the Irishmen in the house
of commons. He has lectured in the United States as well as in
Europe, and is now editor of two weekly papers of large circulation.
He showed his friendliness toward America and his appreciation of
our country's resources by taking unto himself an American wife&mdash;a
beautiful Texan.</p>

<p>At Glasgow I met another member of parliament, Mr. William McKillup,
who, though a citizen of Glasgow, represents an Irish district
and takes an active interest in everything that affects the Emerald isle.</p>

<p>Mr. Harrington and Mr. Redmond took me to the Dublin cemetery
and we visited the graves of O'Connell and Parnell. The tomb of Ireland's
great agitator is under a massive pile of granite, made to represent
an old Irish tower. No monument has yet been erected to Parnell.
The memory of the two dead statesmen and the presence of the living
leaders recalled the struggle to which so many of Ireland's sons have
devoted their lives, and it was a matter of extreme gratification to find
that substantial progress is being made.</p>

<p>It is true that home rule has not yet been secured, but the contest
for home rule has focused attention upon the industrial and political
condition of Erin, and a number of remedial measures have been
adopted. First, the tenant was given title to his improvements and
then the amount of the rent was judicially determined. More recently
the authorities have been building cottages for the rural laborers.
Over 15,000 of these cottages have been already erected and arrangements
are being made for some 19,000 more. These are much more
comfortable than the former dwellings, and much safer from a sanitary
point of view. The recent land purchase act, which went into
effect on November 1, seems likely to exert a very great influence upon
the condition of the people. According to its terms the government
is to buy the land of the landlord and sell it to the tenants. As the
government can borrow money at a lower rate than the ordinary borrower,
it is able to give the tenant much better terms than he gets
from his present landlord, and at the same time purchase the land
of the landlord at a price that is equitable. The landlords are showing
a disposition to comply with the spirit of the law, although some
of them are attempting to get a larger price for their land than it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
worth prior to the passage of the law. The purpose of the law is to
remove from politics the landlord question, which has been a delicate
one to deal with. Most of the larger estates were given to the ancestors
of the present holders and many of the owners live in England and
collect their rents through a local agent. The new law makes the
government the landlord; and the tenant, by paying a certain annual
sum for 63 years, becomes the owner of the fee. He has the privilege
of paying all or any part, at any time, and can dispose of his interest.
The settlement which is now being effected not only removes the friction
which has existed between the tenant and the landlord, but puts
the tenant in a position where he can appeal to the government with
reasonable certainty of redress in case unforeseen circumstances make
his lot harder than at present anticipated. The assurance that he will
become the owner of the fee will give to the Irish farmer an ambition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
that has heretofore been wanting, for he will be able to save without
fear of an increase in the rent. Not only is the land question in
process of settlement, but there have been at the same time other improvements
which make for the permanent progress of the people.
There is a constant increase in educational facilities, and a large number
of co-operative banks have been established. Agricultural societies
have been formed for the improvement of crops and stock, and the
trend is distinctly upward. The Irish leaders have not obtained all
that they labored for&mdash;there is much to be secured before their work
is complete, but when the history of Ireland is written, the leaders
now living will be able to regard with justifiable pride the results
of their devotion and sacrifice and their names will be added to the
long list of Irish patriots and statesmen.</p>

<p>In Dublin I paid my respects to Lord Dudley, lieutenant governor
of Ireland, whose residence, the Viceregal Lodge, is in Phoenix Park,
and found him so genial and affable a host that I am led to hope that
in his administration of the executive branch of the government he
will make the same attempt at just treatment that parliament has made
in the enactment of the recent land measure.</p>

<p>There is a general desire among the leaders of thought in Ireland to
check the emigration from that country. They feel that Ireland under
fair conditions can support a much larger population than she now has.
Ireland, they say, has been drained of many of its most enterprising
and vigorous sons and daughters. It is hardly probable that the steps
already taken will entirely check the movement toward the United
States, but there is no doubt that the inhabitants of Ireland and their
friends across the water contemplate the future with brighter hopes and
anticipations than they have for a century.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLIX.</h2>

<h3>GROWTH OF MUNICIPAL OWNERSHIP.</h3>


<p>Carved in the mantel of the library which adjoins the reception room
of the lord provost of Glasgow is the motto, "Truth will prevail," and
the triumph of truth is illustrated in the development of municipal
ownership in the British Isles.</p>

<p>Probably no city in the world has extended the sphere of municipal
activity further than the metropolis of Scotland&mdash;Glasgow. By the
courtesy of the present lord provost, Sir James Ure Primrose, I learned
something of the manner in which the city of Glasgow is administering
the work that in most of our American cities has been left to private
corporations. It goes without saying that Glasgow owns and operates
its water system, for that is usually the first public work upon which
a city enters. In this case, however, the water instead of being furnished
to the citizens at so much per thousand gallons or at fixed hydrant
rates, is paid for by a tax upon the value of the property. The city's
water supply is brought from Lake Katrine, forty miles away, and a
second pipe line has recently been laid to the lake.</p>

<p>Glasgow also owns the gas plant and furnishes gas to consumers at
about 50 cents per thousand cubic feet. More recently the city has entered
upon the work of supplying electricity, both to the city and to
private houses. The tramways, too, are owned and operated by the
municipality. The service is excellent and the fare depends upon the
distance traveled, 2d (4 cents) being the rate for a long ride and 1d (2
cents) for shorter distances. At certain hours in the day there are work
trams that carry the laboring man from one end of the city to the other
for <sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>2</small></sub>d or 1 cent. The lord provost informed me that it was the settled
policy of the city to use all the income from public service corporations
in improving the service and lessening the charge. In some places the
surplus, as will be shown hereafter, is turned into the city fund and to
that extent lessens the taxes (or rates as city taxes are called in Great
Britain). The municipal authorities in Glasgow have, from the beginning,
opposed this form of indirect taxation and insisted that the service
should be rendered to the public at absolute cost, leaving the people to
support the city government by direct taxation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span></p>

<p>Not only does Glasgow furnish water, gas, electricity and street car
service to its people at cost, but it has undertaken other work still further
in advance of American cities. It has built a number of model
tenement houses for the poor and rents them at something less than the
rate private individuals charge for similar quarters. These buildings
have had for their primary object the improvement of the sanitary
condition of the city. Slums in which disease was rife have been bought,
cleansed and built up, with the result that the death rate has been reduced
in those localities. These tenement houses are rented by the week
or month and the charge for those that I visited was about $36 per year,
this covering taxes and water. The rooms are commodious and well
lighted and each suite contains a cooking range fitted into the chimney
place.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="bridge" id="bridge"></a>
<img src="images/ill225.jpg" width="450" height="301" alt="bridge" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE BROOMELAW BRIDGE AT GLASGOW</p></div>
</div>

<p>The city has also established a number of lodging houses for single
men and here lodgings can be obtained ranging from 3<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>2</small></sub>d (7 cents) to
4<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>2</small></sub>d (9 cents) per night. The lodger has the privilege, and most of them
take advantage of it, of cooking his meals in a large kitchen connected
with the building, and also has the use of the dining room and reading
room. One lodging house is set apart for widowers with children and is,
I am informed, the only one of its kind in the world. About one hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
families, including in all 300 persons, have rooms here. Attendants
are on duty to look after the children during the day while the
fathers are at work, and meals are furnished to such as desire at a minimum
rate.</p>

<p>The reading public is already familiar with the public baths which
have for a number of years been in operation in Glasgow, and to these
baths have been added public washhouses where women can bring the
family linen and at the rate of 2d per hour make use of the tubs and
drying room. I visited one of these wash-rooms and found that the
number of people taking advantage of it during the first year was, in
round numbers, 33,000, in the second year 34,000, in the third year
35,000, and in the fourth year 37,000.</p>

<p>London is also making progress in the work of municipalizing its
public service. The city proper covers a very small territory; in fact, but
a mile square, the greater part of the city being under the control of
what is called the London county council. The London city council
has recently obtained from parliament the right to deal with the water
problem and a commission has been created for this purpose and is
now at work appraising the value of the different water companies
which are to be taken over by the said council. The enormous price
demanded by these companies gives overwhelming proof of London's
folly in having so long delayed the undertaking of this public work.
As there are no surface street cars in the city of London, the city council
has not had the tramway question to deal with. The London county
council has moved much more rapidly than the city council, and I am
indebted to Mr. John Burns, M. P., also councilman for the district of
Battersea, for much valuable information on this subject, he and Mr.
A. J. Shepheard, with whom I crossed the ocean, being kind enough to
introduce me to the members of the county council and to place before
me the statistics in possession of the officials. The county council, besides
taking over the water service, is also furnishing to some extent electricity.
Just now the county council is putting down tramways and preparing to
follow in the footsteps of Glasgow in the matter of furnishing transit
for its citizens. Like Glasgow, the county council is also furnishing
lodging houses for the poorer classes and by so doing is improving the
sanitary conditions of the city. In some portions the council is erecting
tenement houses; here, as in Glasgow, the council selected the worst
portions of the city and substituting modern and well-equipped houses
for the unsightly and unhealthy tenement houses that formerly occupied
the ground. Mr. Burns took me through one of these sections
where about four thousand people are being provided with homes with
every modern improvement and at very low rental. Finding that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
death rate among the children of the poor was alarmingly great, the
county council established a sterilized milk station and the death rate
among the children has been very materially decreased.</p>

<p>Nottingham, England, was visited on the invitation of Mr. A. W.
Black, until recently mayor. I became acquainted with him on the
passage across the Atlantic, and found that he had interested himself
in the work of extending the municipal control of public utilities. From
him and the town clerk, Sir Samuel Johnson, I learned that the city
had been furnishing water to its citizens for about thirty years and gas
for a still longer time. The price of gas has been reduced from time to
time until it is now about 50 cents per thousand for private citizens, and
even at this low rate the gas plant pays into the city treasury a net profit
of about $120,000 a year. It is only about five years since the city entered
upon the work of furnishing electricity, but the profit from that
source is now nearly $45,000 annually. The city has recently taken
over the tramways, and notwithstanding that it has raised the wages of
the employes, shortened their hours of labor, improved the service,
extended the lines and reduced the fares, it has now derived about
$90,000 profit from the earnings of the tramways. This has been the
rule wherever private services have been undertaken by the municipalities.
Nottingham has a population of about 250,000.</p>

<p>I have taken these cities as an illustration, they being the ones concerning
which I have investigated most carefully.</p>

<p>Birmingham furnishes water and light to its people, and has just
decided to take charge of the tramway service. It already owns the
tracks, but has been allowing private corporations to run the cars. The
people have decided to operate the lines in the future.</p>

<p>In Belfast I found that the city had decided to take charge of the
tramway tracks, the only disputed question being whether the city
would pledge itself to the permanent operation of the lines, or reserve
the right to permit private corporations to use the tracks.</p>

<p>Nothing has impressed me more in my visit to the British Isles than
the interest which the leading citizens of the various municipalities are
taking in problems of government and sociology. It must be remembered
that here the members of the city councils receive no pay. The
work they do is entirely gratuitous, and I have found that the councils
are composed of representatives of all classes of society.</p>

<p>Many of the successful business men, professional men and educators
are to be found devoting a portion of their time, sometimes
a very considerable portion, to the work of the city. They attend
meetings, serve on committees and carry on investigations,
and find their recompense not in a salary, but in the honor which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
attaches to the position and in the consciousness that they are giving
something of value to their fellows.</p>

<p>The fact that English cities are doing the work that in American
cities is largely let out to private corporations, may explain the relative
absence of corruption as compared with some of our American cities,
but there is no doubt that among the people generally, service in the city
government is more highly regarded than it is in most of the large
cities of the United States.</p>

<p>I observed with interest the enthusiasm manifested by the officials in
the work being done by the respective cities. At Birmingham, Mr.
Roland H. Barkley, a member of the city council, by request of the lord
mayor called upon me, and not only showed great familiarity with the
work of the city government, but manifested an intense desire to secure
for his city the methods that had been shown by experience to be
the best.</p>

<p>Mr. Black, recently mayor of Nottingham, is a very successful lace
manufacturer, and yet he seemed as much concerned about the affairs of
the city as about the details of his own business. Lord Mayor Harrington
of Dublin, Lord Mayor Dixon of Belfast and Lord Provost Primrose
of Glasgow were all alive to the importance of their work, and seemed
to make the discharge of their duties their chief concern.</p>

<p>In this connection, I desire to record my appreciation of the public
service of one of the most interesting and agreeable men whom I have
met in the Old World, Mr. John Burns. He began his industrial life at
the age of ten as a maker of candles. He was afterward apprenticed as a
machinist, and after acquiring proficiency in his trade followed that line
of employment until his associates made him their representative in the
city government. He was soon afterwards sent to parliament, and has
for some fifteen years represented his district in both bodies. He is only
45, but his hair and beard are so streaked with gray that one would
think him ten years older. He is a little below medium height, strongly
built and very active and energetic. A diligent student, quick-witted
and effective in speech, it is not surprising that he stands today among
the world's foremost representatives of the wage-earners. He is opposed
to both drinking and gambling. He receives no salary, either as a member
of the county council or as a member of parliament, but is supported
by his association, which pays him what is equivalent to a thousand
dollars a year. With this very meager income he devotes his life to
public work, and I have not met a more conscientious or unselfish public
servant, and yet what Mr. Burns is doing on a large scale many
others are doing in a lesser degree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span></p>

<p>I wish that all the citizens of my country could come into contact with
the public men whom I have met, and catch something of the earnestness
with which they are applying themselves to the solution of the
municipal problems that press upon the present generation. It would
certainly increase the velocity of American reforms, and arouse that
latent patriotism which only needs arousing to cope successfully with all
difficulties.</p>

<p>While it may seem that the leaders of municipal government in
Europe are somewhat altruistic in their labors, there is a broader sense
in which they are quite selfish, but it is that laudable selfishness which
manifests itself in one's desire to lift himself up, not by dragging down
others or doing injustice to others but by lifting up the level upon which
all stand. Those who add to the comfort and happiness of their community
are making their own lives and property more secure. Those
who are endeavoring to infuse hope and ambition into the hearts of the
hopeless and their children are working more wisely than those who
are so short-sighted as to believe that the accumulation of money is the
only object of life.</p>

<p>Let us hope that the time is near at hand when the successful business
men in the United States, instead of continuing their accumulations to
the very end of life, will be satisfied with a competency and, when this
is secured, give to the country the benefit of their experience, their intelligence
and their conscience, as many of the business men of England,
Scotland and Ireland are now doing.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER L.</h2>

<h3>FRANCE AND HER PEOPLE.</h3>


<p>My call upon President Loubet was the most interesting incident
of my visit to France. It was arranged by General Horace Porter,
American ambassador to France, who conducted us to the Elysee palace,
which is the White House of the French republic.</p>

<p>President Loubet is probably the most democratic executive that
France has ever had. He reminded me of our former president, Benjamin
Harrison, and of another of our distinguished citizens, Andrew
Carnegie&mdash;not exactly like either, but resembling both&mdash;the former
in appearance, the latter in manner as well as appearance.</p>

<p>President Loubet is below the medium height, even of Frenchmen.
His shoulders are broad and his frame indicative of great physical
strength. His hair is snow white, as are also his beard and mustache.
He wears his beard cut square at the chin.</p>

<p>His eyes are dark blue, suggesting that his hair and beard were
blonde before the years bleached them. His voice is soft, and he speaks
with great vivacity, emphasizing his words by expressive gestures.</p>

<p>He received us in his working room, a beautiful semi-oval apartment,
whose large windows open into the beautiful gardens attached
to the Elysee palace. The oval end of the room bore great priceless
Gobelin tapestry, depicting abundance. On a pedestal under the
tapestry was a marble bust of the Minerva-like head of the Goddess
of Liberty of the French republic.</p>

<p>The president's desk is a long, flat table, eminently business looking,
covered with papers and lighted by two desk lamps and green
shades. A huge electrolier dependent from the frescoed ceiling filled
the room with light.</p>

<p>The president wore a frock coat, the tri-colored button of the Legion
of Honor adorning the lapel.</p>

<p>President Loubet is a very cordial man, and takes pride in the fact
that, like most of our American presidents, he has worked his way
up from the ranks of the common people. His father was a farmer
near the village of Montelimar.</p>

<p>Young Loubet studied law, and then public affairs. He has held
nearly every office in the gift of the people. He began as mayor of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
Montelimar, where his aged mother still lives in the old farmhouse.</p>

<p>He was elected a deputy in 1876, and in 1886 was elected to the
senate. He was minister of public works in 1887, and minister of the
interior in 1892. In 1895 he was elected president of the senate, and
in 1899 he was elected president of the republic.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 355px;"><a name="nappy" id="nappy"></a>
<img src="images/ill226.jpg" width="355" height="550" alt="nappy" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">NAPOLEON BONAPARTE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>He talked freely on various questions that came up for consideration,
and showed himself to be thoroughly informed upon the economic
as well as the political questions with which France has to deal.
His personal popularity and strong good sense have been of inestimable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
value to his country in the trying times caused by the Dreyfus
case.</p>

<p>President Loubet has been prominently connected with the bimetallic
movement, and shows himself familiar with the principles upon
which bimetallists rely in their defense of that system of finance.</p>

<p>The president, like all the Frenchmen whom I met, feels very
friendly toward the United States, and it goes without saying that
France under his administration is not likely to do anything at which
our country can take just offense.</p>

<p>It was gratifying to me to hear him express so much good will, for
it was evidence of the attachment which the French people feel toward
those republican principles of government which they have established
by so much struggle and sacrifice.</p>

<p>Municipal ownership has not made as much progress in France as
in England, although most of the cities now own their water
works, and some of them their lighting plants. The railroads are
nearly all owned by private corporations, but they operate under
charters running about 100 years, half of which time has now elapsed.</p>

<p>According to the charters, the government guaranteed a certain rate
of interest on the investment, besides a certain contribution to the
sinking fund, and at the end of the charter the roads become the
property of the state.</p>

<p>Although it is nearly fifty years before the charters expire, the
course to be adopted by the government is already being discussed,
some insisting that the government should take over the roads and
operate them&mdash;others favoring an arrangement that will continue private
operation, although the government will be the owner of the
property. The same difference of opinion to be found in our country
is to be found here, and some of the high officials are strongly opposed
to the government entering upon the operation of the roads.</p>

<p>President Loubet spoke with evident gratification of the general
diffusion of wealth in France. He said that they had few men of
large fortunes, but a great many men of moderate means, and he felt
that the republic was to be congratulated upon the fact that the
resources of the country are so largely in the hands of the people.</p>

<p>He explained that the government loans were taken by the people in
small amounts and subscribed many times over. Very few of the
bonds representing the French debt are held outside of France. The
debt furnishes a sort of savings bank for the citizens, and their eagerness
to invest in "rentes" (the government bonds) is proof of their
patriotism as well as of their thrift.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span></p>

<p>I heard so much of the French peasant, that I devoted one day
to a visit into the country. Going out some fifty miles from Paris I
found a village of about eighty families. Selecting a representative
peasant, I questioned him about the present condition and prospects
of the French farmer. I found that about three-fourths of the peasants
of that village owned their homes, but that only about one-fourth
owned the farms they tilled.</p>

<p>I should explain that the French peasants do not as a rule live
upon the farms, as is the custom in the United States. With us,
whether a farmer owns forty acres or a quarter section, he usually lives
upon the land, and the houses are therefore scattered at intervals over
the country.</p>

<p>The French peasants, on the contrary, are inclined to gather in villages,
most of them owning their houses and gardens, but going out
into the country to cultivate their fields. Sometimes a peasant will
have a vineyard in one direction from his home, a pasture in another,
and a wheat field or beet field in yet another direction.</p>

<p>These fields are sometimes owned, but more often are rented. The
landlord aims to get about 4 per cent annually on his investment. The
tenant, however, pays the taxes, which sometimes amount to 1 or 2
per cent more.</p>

<p>The peasants complain that the horses which they need to cultivate
their crops are made more expensive by the increased consumption
of horse flesh as food, the demand having raised the price of horses.</p>

<p>The same cause has operated, so I was informed, to reduce the price
of cattle. The widespread use of automobiles has lessened the price of
straw in Paris, and this has been felt by the wheat growers.</p>

<p>I found the peasant with whom I talked to be an ardent protectionist.
He spoke as if the farmers were driven to it as a last resort. As
I was leaving he assured me that he was glad to speak to a "republican"
and said he would not have talked to me at all if I had not
been one.</p>

<p>This was an evidence of his loyalty to the existing régime in France
and also gave additional proof of the fact that the republican party in
the United States has an advantage in appealing to newly-arrived
immigrants merely by reason of its name.</p>

<p>Foreigners are much better acquainted with the word "republic" than
with the word "democracy," and I find that republican speakers have
taken advantage of this fact and represented the republican party as
the only exponent of the doctrines of a republic.</p>

<p>The New York <cite>Independent</cite> about a year ago printed the autobiography
of a foreign born citizen, who presented the same idea and told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a><br /><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>
of a republican speech in which this argument was made by the orator.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><a name="nap" id="nap"></a>
<img src="images/ill227.jpg" width="600" height="352" alt="nap" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">NAPOLEON BONAPARTE CROWNING JOSEPHINE</p></div>
</div>

<p>The birth rate in France scarcely exceeds the death rate, and to my
surprise I found that the increase in the country was even less than in
Paris, in proportion to the population. One Frenchman, apparently
well informed, told me that there were small villages in which it was
difficult to find a child.</p>

<p>In the village which I visited I was told that the families average
two or three children. To show, however, that the small family was
not the universal rule, attention was called to one family there in
which there were eleven children.</p>

<p>The French peasant is a very industrious man, and cultivates his
land with great care, and as soon as he saves a little money he tries
to add to the area of his farm. The wife is usually an efficient helper,
whether in the city or in the country. In the city she is often copartner
with her husband in the store, and assists him to save.</p>

<p>Whether the tendency of the peasants to gather in villages, rather
than to live each on his own farm, is due to their sociability or is a relic
of the feudal system, I cannot say&mdash;both reasons were given.</p>

<p>The French peasant has reason to feel the burden of militarism,
but the recollection of the last war with Germany is so fresh in his
mind that he is not likely to make any vigorous protest as long as he
believes a large army necessary for the protection of the republic.</p>

<p>The sentiment of the French people on this subject is shown by the
fact that the figure representing Alsace-Lorraine in the group of statues
in the beautiful Place de la Concorde is always covered with
mourning wreaths.</p>

<p>I visited the Bank of France, where I was received by the governor,
M. Georges Pallain. The bank's capital stock is about $40,000,000,
and it pays a dividend of about 12 per cent, equal to about 4 per cent
on the present market value of the stock. The deposits are much
smaller in proportion to the capital than are the deposits of our large
American banks. This is true of the Bank of England, and likewise
of the banks of Mexico.</p>

<p>This smaller proportion between the deposits and the capital stock
arrested my attention, because in the United States the proportion is
sometimes so great as to leave little margin for shrinkage in the event
of industrial disturbance. If a bank has loans amounting to ten times
its capital stock, a shrinkage of one-tenth in the value of its assets
would wipe out the capital.</p>

<p>The Bank of France, the Bank of England, and the leading banks
of Mexico seem to be conducted on a more conservative basis. The
Bank of England and the Bank of France differ largely in their note<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a><br /><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span>
issues. The former has the right to issue uncovered notes to the extent
of the bank's loan to the English government. Upon this loan the
bank receives no interest, the note issue being considered an equivalent,
as no reserve is required to be kept against these notes. The bank
can also issue notes in addition to these, but I found to my surprise
that this note issue is not profitable to the bank, since these notes are
virtually gold certificates, the bank being required to keep on hand
an equal amount of gold as a redemption fund.</p>

</div>

<p>The Bank of France has outstanding nearly $900,000,000 in notes,
which is the paper money of the country. The bank has the option of
redeeming these notes either in gold or silver, and it exercises that
option by refusing to pay gold when gold becomes scarce, or when
it seems undesirable to furnish gold for export.</p>

<p>It has recently refused gold, and those desiring to export that
metal have had to purchase it at a slight premium.</p>

<p>The "gold contract," which has become so common in the United
States, and which was used to terrorize the public in 1896, seems to
be unknown in France; or at least I could find no one who knew anything
about such contracts. They are regarded as contrary to public
policy.</p>

<p>The president of the Bank of France is appointed by the government,
so that the bank stands in a different attitude toward the government
from the national banks of our country.</p>

<p>I had the pleasure of meeting a number of prominent Frenchmen
during my visit to Paris, among them Senator Combes, the prime
minister, who is just now a most conspicuous figure in the contest
between the government and the various religious orders; Senator
Clemenceau, one of the ablest editors in Paris, and a brilliant conversationalist;
Baron d'Estonelles de Constant, a man of high ideals and
leader of the peace movement in France; the Rev. Albert Kohler,
author of "The Religion of Effort," and the Rev. Charles Wagner,
whose book, "The Simple Life," has had such a large circulation in
the United States.</p>

<p>The Rev. Mr. Wagner is just such a looking man as you would
expect to write such a book&mdash;strong, rugged and earnest. He impresses
one as a man with a mission, and although young in years, he has
already made an impress upon the thought of the world. His book
is a protest against the materialism which is making man the slave of
his possessions.</p>

<p>The influence which Mr. Wagner has already exerted shows the
power of a great thought, even when it must cross the boundaries of
nations and pass through translation into many different tongues. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a><br /><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
shall remember my communion with this apostle of simplicity as one
remembers a visit to a refreshing spring.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">TOMB OF NAPOLEON.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Dr. Max Nordau, the famous author of "Degeneracy," although a
German, lives in Paris. I enjoyed my call upon him very much.
One quickly recognizes the alertness of his mind, his brilliant powers
of generalization and his aptness in epigram. I also had the pleasure
of meeting Senator Fougeirol, a noted advocate of bimetallism.</p>

<p>The visitor to Paris is immediately impressed by the magnificence
of the city's boulevards, parks and public squares. There is an elegant
spaciousness about the boulevards and squares that surpasses anything
I have seen elsewhere.</p>

<p>Parisians assert that the Avenue des Champs Elysees is the finest in
the world, and so far as my observation goes I am not prepared to
dispute the claim. The beauty of Paris deserves all the adjectives
that have been lavished upon it.</p>

<p>One might dwell at length upon the almost endless array of brilliant
shop windows where jewelry, bric-a-brac, hats, gowns and mantles
are displayed (and I am not surprised that Paris is the Mecca for
women), but I desire to refer briefly to the more permanent beauty
of Paris&mdash;the beauty of its architecture, sculpture and paintings.</p>

<p>Paris' public buildings, ancient and modern, combine solidity with
beauty. The statues, columns and arches that adorn the parks and
boulevards bespeak the skill of the artists and the appreciation of the
public which pays for their maintenance.</p>

<p>Paris' many picture galleries, chief of which are the Louvre and
the Luxembourg, contain, as all the world knows, extraordinary collections
of treasures of art. The encouragement given by the government
to every form of art has made Paris the abode of students from
the four corners of the earth.</p>

<p>The huge palaces at Versailles and Fontainebleau are interesting
relics of the monarchical period, and they are instructive, also, in that
they draw a contrast between the days of the empire and the present
time. The extremes of society have been drawn closely together by
the growth of democracy, and the officials chosen by the people and
governing by authority of the people are much nearer to the people who
pay the taxes and support the government than the kings who lived
in gorgeous palaces and claimed to rule by right divine.</p>

<p>I have left to the last those reminders of earlier France which are
connected with the reigns of Napoleon. You cannot visit Paris without
being made familiar with the face of the "Little Corsican," for it
stares at you from the shop windows and looks down at you from the
walls of palaces and galleries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span></p>

<p>You see the figure of "the man of destiny" in marble and bronze,
sometimes on a level with the eye, sometimes piercing the sky, as it
does in the Place Vendome, where it is perched on top of a lofty column,
whose pedestal and sides are covered with panels in relief made
from cannon captured by Napoleon in battle.</p>

<p>The gigantic Arch of Triumph on the Champs Elysees, commenced
by Napoleon, in commemoration of his successes, testifies to the splendor
of his conceptions.</p>

<p>But overshadowing all other Napoleonic monuments is his tomb
on the banks of the Seine, adjoining the Invalides. Its gilded dome
attracts attention from afar, and on nearer approach one is charmed
with the strength of its walls and the symmetry of its proportions.</p>

<p>At the door the guard cautions the thoughtless to enter with uncovered
head, but the admonition is seldom necessary, for an air of solemnity
pervades the place.</p>

<p>In the center of the rotunda, beneath the frescoed vault of the great
dome, is a circular crypt. Leaning over the heavy marble balustrade
I gazed on the massive sarcophagus below which contains all that
was mortal of that marvelous combination of intellect and will.</p>

<p>The sarcophagus is made of dark red porphyry, a fitly chosen stone
that might have been colored by the mingling of the intoxicating wine
of ambition with the blood spilled to satisfy it.</p>

<p>Looking down upon the sarcophagus and the stands of tattered
battle flags that surround it, I reviewed the tragic career of this
grand master of the art of slaughter, and weighed, as best I could, the
claims made for him by his friends. And then I found myself wondering
what the harvest might have been had Napoleon's genius led
him along peaceful paths, had the soil of Europe been stirred by the
plowshare rather than by his trenchant blade, and the reaping done
by implements less destructive than his shot and shell.</p>

<p>Just beyond and above the entombed emperor stands a cross upon
which hangs a life-size figure of the Christ, flooded by a mellow lemon-colored
light, which pours through the stained glass windows of the
chapel.</p>

<p>I know not whether it was by accident or design that this god of
war thus sleeps, as it were, at the very feet of the Prince of Peace.</p>

<p>Whether so intended or not, it will, to those who accept the teachings
of the Sermon on the Mount, symbolize love's final victory over
force and the triumph of that philosophy which finds happiness in
helpful service and glory in doing good.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LI.</h2>

<h3>THE REPUBLIC OF SWITZERLAND.</h3>


<p>No wonder Switzerland is free. The beauty of the country inspires
a love of native land and the mountains form a natural fortress behind
which the Swiss people could withstand armies many times the size of
their own. Nowhere can one find as great a variety of landscape in a
day's ride by train as in Switzerland. The road from Berne via
Chiasso, on the Italian border, to Italy, passes along the shores of lakes
whose transparent waters reflect the precipitous rocks that overhang
them; by mountain streams that dash and foam madly as if anxious
to escape from the solitude of the hills into the companionship of the
larger waters of lake and sea, across the gorges, around the foothills
and through the nine-mile tunnel of St. Gothard, which pierces the
mountain a mile beneath the summit, and then down into the valleys
that widen out from the base of the Alps. The day's enthralling ride
reminds one of a cinematographic film, so quickly do the views change
and so different is each from the other. Along the lower levels are
tiny farms and vineyards, a little higher up are terraced pastures and
quaint farm houses, with gabled roofs&mdash;often residence and barn are
under the same roof! The mountain sides are scarred with chutes
down which the peasants drag timber on the snow. One passes
through a great variety of climate in descending from the City of
Mexico to Vera Cruz, but there one does not see such a succession of
picturesque views as greets the eye in the ride across the Alps.</p>

<p>One would suppose that the people of Switzerland could find ample
employment in supplying the wants of those who temporarily visit
their land, but to the industry of hotelkeeping are added two that
have made Switzerland famous throughout the world&mdash;watchmaking
and wood carving. While watches are manufactured as well and
as cheaply in the United States as in Switzerland, this industry is one
that makes its presence known in every city of this mountain republic.
The genius of the Swiss for wood carving manifests itself in innumerable
ways. The cuckoo clock and the bear&mdash;the symbol of Switzerland,
as the eagle is of the United States&mdash;are seen in shop windows everywhere;
the bear in innumerable postures, the clock in innumerable
sizes. At Berne I found some wooden nut-crackers formed to resemble
a head, the lower jaw working as a lever and crushing the nut against
the upper jaw. I observed one nut-cracker made to resemble President<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
Roosevelt, and another former Colonial Secretary Chamberlain
of England. I presume that the manufacturer intended to suggest
that these two statesmen have more nuts to crack just now than any
other men of political prominence!</p>

<p>More interesting, however, than its scenery or its industries is the
government of Switzerland. It is the most democratic government on
the face of the earth, if the word democratic is taken to mean the
rule of the people, for in Switzerland the people rule more completely
than anywhere else. In some of the small cantons the people meet at
stated times and act upon political matters in public meeting, recalling
the old town hall meeting of New England. In all the cantons
and in the federal government they have the initiative and referendum.
The latter has been in use since 1874; the former has been
adopted more recently.</p>

<p>From the courteous assistant secretary of state I learned that during
the last twenty-nine years 235 federal laws have been submitted to the
people by means of the referendum, of which 210 were adopted and
twenty-five rejected. The total voting population of Switzerland is
about 768,000, and it requires a petition signed by 30,000&mdash;less than
5 per cent of the voting population&mdash;to secure a referendum vote on
any bill. Fifty thousand voters can petition for the enactment of any
desired law, and when such a petition is filed the federal legislature
can either pass the law or refuse to pass it. If it refuses, however, its
action must be passed upon by a referendum vote. Since the existence
of this provision six petitions have been presented, and in every case
the legislature refused to pass the law demanded by the petitioners.
In five cases the people at the referendum vote sustained the legislature;
in one case the action of the legislature was overruled by the
voters. In this instance the people had petitioned for the passage of
a law that would prevent the slaughter of animals for food until after
they had been rendered insensible.</p>

<p>I found that the Swiss people are so pleased with the popular control
over government, given them by the initiative and referendum, that
there is no possibility that any party will attempt to attack it, although
there are some that would prefer the representative system freed from
the restraint which the initiative and referendum give. Their arguments
are, first, that the legislators knowing that the people can initiate
legislation feel less responsibility; and, second, that as the legislators'
actions can be reviewed by the people, the legislators are more timid
about introducing needed reforms. The friends of the initiative
and referendum meet these arguments by declaring that the legislators
are really not relieved from responsibility, but on the other hand are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
incited to action by the fact that the people can act in the event that
their interests are neglected by the legislature and that the timidity
suggested is only likely to prevent legislation when the legislators
themselves doubt the merit of the proposed action.</p>

<p>By courtesy of the American minister, Mr. Hill, I had the honor of
meeting Dr. Adolphe Deucher, "president of the Swiss confederation,"
as he is styled. He is of German blood, as his name would indicate,
and he is a fine representative of the scholarly, big-hearted Teuton.
He is a tall, slender man, of about 60, with a ruddy face, white mustache
and scanty white hair. He speaks with frankness and conviction
and is as simple in his manners as the humblest of his people. He
has been president once before, and has represented his canton in the
federal legislature. He lives very unostentatiously, as becomes an
official whose salary is only $2,750 a year. He receives $250 a year
more than his colleagues in the federal council. Switzerland has no
executive mansion and the president lives in a modest hotel.</p>

<p>Three languages are spoken in Switzerland&mdash;French, German,
Italian. French prevails in the region about Geneva, German in and
north of Berne and Italian at the southeast near the Italian border.
German is, perhaps, dominant, if any one tongue can be said to dominate,
with French and Italian following in the order named. The
debates in the federal legislature are conducted in the three tongues,
and are reported therein officially. No attempt is made to interfere
with the teaching of the language that each of the three communities
desires, the cantons being independent in matters of local legislation,
just as are the states in our country. There seems to be no jealousy or
enmity between the different sections except to the extent of a healthful
rivalry between them. The feeling of independence, however, is so
strong that no federal government could exist without a clear recognition
of the rights of the component states or cantons.</p>

<p>As a nation, Switzerland, with her five million people, does not attract
the attention that neighboring nations do, and in a contest at
arms, except upon her own soil, she could not hope to achieve much,
but in that high form where conscience dictates and where reason
rules she is a conspicuous member of the sisterhood of nations. If we
believe the world to be making progress toward nobler national ideals,
we may expect Switzerland to occupy a position of increasing importance,
for the love of liberty that characterizes her people, the democratic
character of her institutions and the industry of her citizens all
combine to give her assurance of increasing prestige.</p>

<p>I cannot refrain here from giving expression to a thought that has
grown upon me since my arrival in Europe. I found our ambassador<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
to England, Mr. Choate, preparing to leave his residence in Carlton
House Terrace, London, because of the prospective return of its
owner, Lord Curzon, from India. I learned that our ambassadors to
France have often found difficulty in finding suitable houses in Paris,
while I found that our minister to Switzerland, Mr. Hill, is living in
Geneva because he has not been able thus far to find a residence in
Berne, the capital. I was also informed that our ambassador to Italy,
Mr. Meyer, was compelled to live in a hotel in Rome for a year after
his appointment, because he was unable to find a suitable house for
the embassy. The trials of our diplomatic representatives in Europe,
together with the high rents they are compelled to pay for their residences,
have convinced me that we as a people are at fault in not providing
permanent and appropriate domiciles for our ambassadors and
ministers at foreign capitals. In the great cities of Europe it is not
only impossible to rent at a moderate price a house suitable for our
embassy, but it is often difficult to secure a convenient location at any
price. It is scarcely democratic to place upon an official an expense so
great as to preclude the appointment of a man of moderate means; nor
does it comport with the dignity of our nation to make the choice of
an ambassadorial or ministerial residence dependent upon chance and
circumstance. I have been pleased to observe that our representatives
in Europe are conspicuous in the diplomatic circle at court functions
because of their modest attire, but it is not necessary that our
ambassadors' and ministers' homes should be on wheels in order to
be democratic. I believe that our government ought to inaugurate a
new policy in this matter and build up in the chief capitals of foreign
nations on land convenient to the foreign office buildings suitable in
every way for the residences and offices of our diplomatic representatives.
Such buildings constructed according to a characteristic
American style of architecture and furnished like an American home
would not only give to our representative a fixed habitation, but would
exhibit to the people of the country in which he is accredited the
American manner of living. The records of the embassy could be
kept more safely in permanent quarters.</p>

<p>As real estate in all the capitals of Europe is rapidly rising in value,
land purchased now would become a profitable investment and the
rent estimated on the purchase price would be a great deal less than
will have to be paid twenty or fifty years from now for a suitable site
and buildings conveniently located. It is not wise to confine our
diplomatic representation to the circle of the wealthy, and it is much
better to furnish our ambassadors and ministers with residences than to
increase their salaries.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LII.</h2>

<h3>THREE LITTLE KINGDOMS.</h3>


<p>I shall treat in this article of my visit to three little kingdoms in the
north of Europe&mdash;Denmark, Belgium and The Netherlands.</p>

<p>I passed through the edge of Sweden on my way from Berlin to
Copenhagen and was at Malmo a short time; but, as it was Christmas
day and early in the morning, few stores were open, and I did not have
an opportunity to see many people. I had intended to visit Stockholm,
the capital of Sweden, but a day's delay in Russia deprived me of that
pleasure.</p>

<p>Copenhagen is not only the capital of Denmark, but its commercial
metropolis as well. The city has the air of a seaport. The canal leading
from the harbor up to the center of the town was crowded with boats
which had taken up their winter quarters, and the multitude of masts
told of the numbers of those who live upon the ocean.</p>

<p>Denmark is a densely populated country composed of the Jutland
peninsula and a number of islands. The land is for the most part level
and not much above the sea. The farmers of Denmark have distinguished
themselves in several departments of agriculture, especially in
butter-making&mdash;Danish butter commanding the highest price in London
and other large markets.</p>

<p>Copenhagen has some very substantial buildings and an art gallery in
which the works of Thorwaldsen, the sculptor, occupy the chief place.</p>

<p>The people of Denmark, while living under an hereditary monarch,
have a written constitution, and parliament is the controlling influence
in the government. Until recently, the sovereign insisted upon selecting
his cabinet ministers to suit himself; but, about three years ago, he
yielded to the demand of parliament that the dominant party in that
body be permitted to furnish the king's advisers. The change has
proven so satisfactory that perfect harmony now exists between the
royal family and the legislative body.</p>

<p>King Christian is advanced in years and is so beloved by his people
that he goes among them without attendants or guards.</p>

<p>The heir to the throne of Denmark, Prince Frederick, upon whom,
by the courtesy of the American minister, Mr. Swensen, I was able to
call on Christmas afternoon, is very democratic in his manner, and very
cordial in his friendship for America.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span></p>

<p>If marrying daughters to crowned heads is a test, the late Queen
of Denmark was a very successful mother. One of her daughters is
mother of the present emperor of Russia, another is wife of the present
king of England, and a third is married to one of the smaller kings of
Germany. A son, it may be added, is king of Greece.</p>

<p>I had the pleasure of meeting the prime minister and also Professor
Matzen, the president of the state university and Denmark's member of
The Hague tribunal. He was one of the leading opponents of the
transfer of the Danish islands to the United States.</p>

<p>I learned while in Denmark that one of the chief reasons for the opposition
to the sale of the Danish islands to the United States was the
fact that the United States did not guarantee full citizenship to the
inhabitants of those islands. The nation's conduct elsewhere prevented
this. Our refusal to give the Porto Ricans and the Filipinos the protection
of the constitution is largely to blame for the loss of the Danish
islands to our country.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">KING CHRISTIAN AND WIFE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The Danish officials whom I met were deeply interested in the United
States, and naturally so, for, like Sweden and Norway, Denmark has
sent many sons and daughters to the United States; and these, as have
the Swedes and Norwegians, have deported themselves so well as to
establish close ties between the mother countries and their adopted land.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LIII.</h2>

<h3>BELGIUM.</h3>


<p>Belgium is a busy hive. Its people are crowded together and are very
industrious. The farmers and truck gardeners have reduced agriculture
to a fine art and the lace workers are famous for their skill.</p>

<p>Nowhere did I see man's faithful friend, the dog, utilized as in Belgium.
He helps to haul the carts along the streets, and his services are
so highly prized that large dogs are untaxed, while the small house dog,
being an idler, has to contribute his annual quota to the expenses of the
government.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="justice" id="justice"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">PALACE OF JUSTICE&mdash;BELGIUM</p></div>
</div>

<p>The elegance of some of the public buildings and the beauty of the
streets of Brussels surprise one, if he has allowed himself to judge Belgium
by her dimensions on the map. Historical interest, however, is
centered, not in Brussels, but in the battlefield of Waterloo, some miles
away. In the summer time, thousands of tourists (among whom, according
to the guides, are but few Frenchmen) turn their steps toward this
field which witnessed the overthrow of the greatest military genius of
his generation, if not of all time.</p>

<p>The scene of carnage is now marked by an enormous artificial mound
130 feet in height and surmounted by an immense stone lion&mdash;the Lion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>
of Waterloo. The animal looks toward the point from which Napoleon
made his last charge and seems to be watching lest the attack may be
renewed. Wellington, upon visiting the battlefield after the erection of
this mound, is said to have complained that they had ruined the battlefield
to secure dirt for this stupendous pile, and it is true that the surface
of the earth in that vicinity has been very much altered. In leveling
the knolls they have destroyed one of the most interesting landmarks
of the battlefield&mdash;the sunken road in which so many of the French
soldiers lost their lives. As the guide tells it, Napoleon asked a Belgian
peasant if there was any ravine to be crossed between him and the
enemy's lines, and the peasant replied in the negative; but when the
French rushed over this knoll, they came suddenly and unexpectedly
upon a narrow road in a cut about twenty feet deep, and, falling in,
filled up the cut until succeeding ranks crossed over on their dead
bodies.</p>

<p>The field, as a whole, might be described as a rolling prairie, although
the visitor is told of groves no longer standing. At the Hugomond farm,
the walls of the house bear evidence of the conflict that raged nearly a
century ago, and one is shown the ruins of an old well in which, it is
said, the bodies of 300 English soldiers were buried. This portion of the
battlefield reminds one somewhat of that portion of the battlefield of
Gettysburg which was made famous by Pickett's charge, although there
are but few monuments at Waterloo to mark the places occupied by the
various brigades and divisions.</p>

<p>At a restaurant near the mound one is shown the chair in which,
according to tradition, Wellington sat when he was laying his plans for
the last day's battle, and you can, for a franc each, secure bullets warranted
to have been found upon the field. It is rumored, however, that
some of the bullets now found are of modern make and that thrifty
peasants sow them as they do grain, and gather them for the benefit
of tourists.</p>

<p>I found Europe agitated by a remark recently made by the emperor
of Germany which gave the Prussian troops credit for saving the English
and winning the day, but the French are as quick to dispute this
claim as the English. The comedians have taken the matter up in the
British Isles, and, at one London theatre, an actor dressed as an Englishman,
is made to meet a German and, after an exchange of compliments,
the English brings down the house by saying: "I beg pardon!
It may be a little late, but let me thank you for saving us at Waterloo."</p>

<p>It is hardly worth while for the allies to quarrel over the division of
credit. There was glory enough for all&mdash;and it required the co-operation
of all to overcome the genius and the strategy of Bonaparte.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LIV.</h2>

<h3>THE NETHERLANDS.</h3>


<p>Between Waterloo, one of the world's most renowned battlefields, and
The Hague, which is to be the home of the Temple of Peace&mdash;what a
contrast; and yet Belgium and The Netherlands lie side by side! Perhaps
the contrast is chronological rather than geographical or racial, for
the Dutch have had their share of fighting on their own soil, as they
had their part in the victory of 1815. It seems especially appropriate
that The Hague should be chosen as the permanent meeting place of the
peace tribunal, for it is not only centrally located for European countries,
and, being small, is not itself tempted to appeal to arms, but it has
long been the home of religious liberty, and its people were pioneers in
the defense of the doctrine that rulers exist for the people, not the
people for the rulers.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="hague" id="hague"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE HAGUE</p></div>
</div>

<p>The capital of The Netherlands&mdash;The Hague&mdash;(the name is taken
from the forest that adjoins) is a beautiful little city and will furnish
an appropriate setting for the building which Mr. Carnegie's generosity
is to provide. Plans are already being prepared for this structure, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
one of the officials showed me a picture representing Peace, which may
be reproduced upon the ceiling or walls.</p>

<p>In the gallery at Moscow I saw a painting by the great Russian
artist, Vereshchagin. It is a pyramid of whitened skulls standing out
against a dark background, and is dedicated to "The Warriors of the
World." It tells the whole story of war in so solemn, impressive, and
terrible a way that Von Moltke is said to have issued an order prohibiting
German officers from looking at it when it was exhibited at Berlin.</p>

<p>The emperor of Russia, who has the distinction and the honor of
having called together the conference which resulted in The Hague
tribunal, might with great propriety contribute to the Temple of Peace
this masterpiece of one of his countrymen, portraying so vividly the
evils which arbitration is intended to remedy.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE MARKET PLACE AT AMSTERDAM.</p></div>
</div>

<p>One of the members of the arbitration court told me that it was both
interesting and instructive to note how the nations appearing before
that court emphasized, not so much their pecuniary claims, as the honor
of their respective nations and the justice of their acts.</p>

<p>No one can foresee or foretell how great an influence The Hague
tribunal will have upon the world's affairs, but it would seem difficult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
to exaggerate it. It is cultivating a public opinion which will in time
coerce the nations into substituting arbitration for violence in the settlement
of international disputes; and it ought to be a matter of gratification
to every American that our country is taking so active a part in the
forwarding of the movement.</p>

<p>But The Hague is not the only place of interest in The Netherlands.
The land replevined from the sea by the sturdy Dutch and protected by
dykes, the spot immortalized by the temporary sojourn of the Pilgrims,
the familiar blue china, the huge wind mills with their deliberate movements,
the wooden
shoes, and the numerous
waterways&mdash;all
these attract the
attention of the tourist.</p>

<p>And the commercial
metropolis of
Holland,&mdash;Amsterdam&mdash;what
a quaint
old city it is! Its
more than three
hundred canals
roaming their way
through the city,
and its hundreds of
bridges, have given
to it the name of
"The Northern Venice,"
and it well deserves
the appellation.
The houses
are built on piles,
and as many of them
are settling, they lean in every direction, some out toward the street,
some back, and some toward the side. The houses are so dependent
upon each other for support, it is a common saying in that city
that if you want to injure your neighbor, you have only to pull down
your own house.</p>

<p>Amsterdam is the center of the diamond cutting industry of the
world, more than ten thousand hands being employed in that work. As
is well known, the Dutch are a rich people, and their commerce, like
their mortgages, can be found everywhere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span></p>

<p>They have a constitutional monarchy, but they have universal education
and parliamentary government, and are jealous of their political
rights.</p>

<p>Denmark, Belgium and The Netherlands&mdash;three little kingdoms!
Small in area, but brimful of people, and these people have their part
in the solving of problems with which Europe is now grappling.</p>

<h3>GERMANY AND SOCIALISM.</h3>


<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="reichstag" id="reichstag"></a>
<img src="images/ill236.jpg" width="450" height="303" alt="reichstag" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE REICHSTAG</p></div>
</div>

<p>At Berlin I found, as I had at London and Paris, a considerable
number of Americans and, as in the other cities, they have organized a
society, the object of which is to bring the American residents together
for friendly intercourse. At London the group is known as the American
Society; at Paris and Berlin the society is known as the American
Chamber of Commerce. Through the receptions given by these societies
I was able to meet not only the leading American residents, but
many foreigners who came as invited guests. Our American residents are
evidently conducting themselves well, because I found that they are well
liked by the people among whom they are temporarily sojourning. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span>
am indebted to Ambassador Tower and to the American Chamber of
Commerce for courtesies extended me at Berlin.</p>

<p>My visit to Germany occurred at Christmas time and while it was for
that reason impossible to see the kaiser (much to my regret), I learned
something of the German method of observing the great Christian holiday.
The German is essentially a domestic man and at Christmas time
especially gives himself up to the society of the family, relatives and
friends. Christmas coming on Friday, the festivities covered three days,
Friday, Saturday and Sunday. The toys&mdash;in which Germany abounds&mdash;were
of endless variety, and the Christmas trees, bending beneath
their load, were centers of interest to the young folks. There were dolls
and dogs, horses and woolly sheep, cows that give milk, and soldiers&mdash;an
abundance of soldiers. I saw one cavalry man with a saber in his
hand. When he was wound up, the horse would rush forward and the
rider would strike with his saber, as if he were keeping watch on the
Rhine and in the very act of resisting an attack from the enemy. A
little strange that the birthday of the Prince of Peace should be celebrated
by the presentation of toys illustrating mimic warfare! But, as in
America we are increasing our army and enlarging our navy, we are
not in a very good position to take the military mote out of the eye of
our friends in the fatherland.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="leipsic" id="leipsic"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">LEIPSIC UNIVERSITY.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Berlin is a splendid city with beautiful streets, parks and public
buildings. It is more modern in appearance than either London or
Paris, and there is a solidity and substantialness about the population<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span>
that explain the character of the emigration from Germany to America.
No one can look upon a gathering of average Germans without recognizing
that he is in the presence of a strong, intelligent and masterful
people. Bismarck has left his impress upon Germany as Napoleon did
upon France. An heroic statue of the man of "blood and iron" stands
between the reichstag and the column of Victory, which was erected at
the close of the Franco-Prussian war. The reichstag is a massive but
graceful structure, built some twenty years ago. In one of the corridors
I noticed a silk flag which was presented in the seventies by the German
women of America. The reichstag proper is a popular body, much like
the English parliament, and, as in England, the members do not necessarily
reside in the districts they represent. The upper house or bundesrath,
is somewhat like our senate in one respect, namely, that it represents
the various states that comprise the German empire, but it differs
from our senate, first, in that the subdivisions are represented somewhat
in proportion to population, and, second, in that the members of the
bundesrath are really ambassadors of the several state governments
whose credentials can be withdrawn at any time. As all legislation must
be concurred in by the bundesrath, as well as by the reichstag, it will be
seen that the German government is not nearly so responsive to the
will of the people as the governments of England, Denmark and the
Netherlands.</p>

<p>In the reichstag they have resorted to a device for saving time in roll
call. Each member is supplied with a quantity of tickets, some pink and
some white. Each ticket bears on both sides the name of the member.
On the white tickets the word "Ja" (yes) appears under the name, on
the pink ones "Nein" (no). These ballots are gathered up in vases containing
two receptacles, one white and the other pink. The vases are
carried through the hall and the votes deposited according to color. As
they are deposited in the different receptacles and are distinguished by
color, the ballot is quickly taken and counted&mdash;in about one-fourth the
time, I think, formerly required for roll call. This is a method which
our congress might find it convenient to adopt.</p>

<p>It was my good fortune, while in Berlin, to meet Dr. Otto Arendt, the
leading bimetallist of Germany. He became a student of the money
question while in college, being converted to the double standard by the
writings of Cernucshi, the great French economist. Dr. Arendt is a
member of the reichstag, from one of the agricultural constituencies.
He has represented his government in international conferences and
has urged his government to join in an agreement to restore bimetallism,
but, like other advocates of the double standard, has found the
English financiers an immovable obstruction in the way.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span></p>

<p>I have for two reasons reserved for this article some comments on the
growth of socialism in Europe. First, because Germany was to be the
last of the larger countries visited, and, second, because socialism seems
to be growing more rapidly in Germany than anywhere else. I find that
nearly all the European nations have carried collective ownership farther
than we have in the United States. In a former article, reference
has already been made to the growth of municipal ownership in England
and Scotland, and I may add that where the private ownership of
public utilities is still permitted the regulation of the corporations holding
these franchises is generally more strict than in the United States.
Let two illustrations suffice: Where parliament charters gas and water
companies in cities, it has for some years been the practice to limit the
dividends that can be earned&mdash;any surplus earnings over and above the
dividends allowed must be used in reducing the price paid by the consumer.
I fear that our money magnates would be at a loss to find words
to express their indignation if any such restriction were suggested in
America, and yet is it not a just and reasonable restriction?</p>

<p>In the case of railroads, I noticed that there are in England but few
grade (or, as they call them, "level") crossings. I am informed that
railroad accidents and injuries are not so frequent in England as in the
United States.</p>

<p>In Switzerland the government has recently acquired the principal
railroad systems. In Holland, Belgium and Denmark also the railroads
are largely government roads. In Russia the government owns and operates
the roads and I found there a new form of collectivism, namely,
the employment of a community physician, who treats the people without
charge. These physicians are employed by societies called Zemstro,
which have control of the roads and the care of the sick.</p>

<p>In Germany, however, socialism as an economic theory is being urged
by a strong and growing party. In the last general election the socialists
polled a little more than three million votes out of a total of about
nine and a half millions. Measured by the popular vote it is now the
strongest party in Germany. The fact that with thirty-one per cent of
the vote it only has eighty-one members of the reichstag out of a total
of 397 is due, in part, to the fact that the socialist vote is massed in the
cities and, in part, to the fact that the population has increased more
rapidly in the cities, and, as there has been no recent redistricting, the
socialist city districts are larger than the districts returning members of
other parties.</p>

<p>George von Vollmar, a member of the reichstag, in a recent issue of
the National Review thus states the general purpose of the social democratic
party in Germany:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is well known that social democracy in all countries, as its name
indicates, aims in the first place at social and economic reform. It
starts from the point of view that economic development, the substitution
of machinery for hand implements, and the supplanting of small
factories by gigantic industrial combinations, deprive the worker in an
ever increasing degree of the essential means of production, thereby
converting him into a possessionless proletarian, and that the means of
production are becoming the exclusive possession of a comparatively
small number of capitalists,
who constantly monopolize
all the advantages
which the gigantic increase
in the productive
capacity of human effort
has brought about. Thus,
according to the social
democrats, capital is master
of all the springs of
life, and lays a yoke on
the working classes in
particular, and the whole
population in general,
which ever becomes more
and more unbearable.
The masses, as their insight
into the general
trend of affairs develops,
become daily more and
more conscious of the contrast
between the exploiter
and the exploited, and
in all countries with an
industrial development
society is divided into two
hostile camps, which wage
war on each other with
ever increasing bitterness.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 250px;"><a name="kaiser" id="kaiser"></a>
<img src="images/ill239.jpg" width="250" height="379" alt="kaiser" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">KAISER WILHELM.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"To this class-war is due the origin and continuous development of
social democracy, the chief task of which is to unite these factions in an
harmonious whole which they will direct to its true goal. Industrial
combination on a large scale can be converted from a source of misery
and oppression into a source of the greatest prosperity and of harmonious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span>
perfection, when the means of production cease to be the exclusive
appanage of capital and are transferred to the hands of society at large.
The social revolution here indicated implies the liberation not only of
the proletariat, but of mankind as a whole, which suffers from the decomposing
influence of existing class antagonism whereby all social
progress is crippled."</p>

<p>One of the most influential of the German socialists, in answer to a
series of questions submitted by me, said in substance:</p>

<p>First, the general aim of socialists in Germany is the same as the aim
of other socialists throughout the world&mdash;namely, the establishment of
a collective commonwealth based on democratic equality.</p>

<p>Second, the socialists of Germany have organized a liberal party of
unrivaled strength; they have educated the working classes to a very
high standard of political intelligence and to a strong sense of their
independence and of their social mission, as the living and progressive
force in every social respect; they have promoted the organization of
trade unions; and have by their incessant agitation compelled the other
parties and the government to take up social and labor legislation.</p>

<p>Third, German socialists at present are contending for a legal eight-hour
day and for the creation of a labor department in the government,
with labor officers and labor chambers throughout the country. In addition
to these special reforms, socialists are urging various constitutional
and democratic reforms in the states and municipalities&mdash;in the latter
housing reforms, direct employment of labor, etc.</p>

<p>Fourth, there may be some difference of opinion among socialists in
regard to the competitive system, but, being scientific evolutionists, they
all agree that competition was at one time a great step in advance and
acted for generations as a social lever of industrial progress, but they
believe that it has many evil consequences and that it is now being outgrown
by capitalistic concerns, whose power to oppress has become a
real danger to the community. They contend that there is not much
competition left with these monopolies and that as, on the other hand,
education and the sense of civic responsibility are visibly growing, and
will grow more rapidly when socialism gets hold of the public mind,
socialists think that the time is approaching when all monopolies must
and can safely be taken over by the state or municipality as the case
may be. This would not destroy all competition at once&mdash;in industries
not centralized some competition might continue to exist. In this respect,
also, all socialists are evolutionists, however they may differ as to
ways and means and political methods.</p>

<p>Fifth, as to the line between what are called natural monopolies and
ordinary industries, the question is partly answered by the preceding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a><br /><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>
paragraph. There is a general consensus of opinion that natural monopolies
should, in any case, be owned by the community.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><a name="breton" id="breton"></a>
<img src="images/ill240.jpg" width="600" height="350" alt="breton" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">BRETON PEASANTS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>I find that even in Germany there are degrees among socialists&mdash;some
like Babel and Singer emphasizing the ultimate ends of socialism, while
others led by Bernstein are what might be called progressionists or opportunists&mdash;that
is, they are willing to take the best they can get to-day
and from that vantage ground press on to something better. It is certain
that the socialists of Germany are securing reforms, but so far they
are reforms which have either already been secured in other countries
or are advocated elsewhere by other parties as well as by the socialist
party.</p>

<p>The whole question of socialism hangs upon the question: Is competition
an evil or a good? If it is an evil, then monopolies are right and
we have only to decide whether the monopolies should be owned by the
state or by private individuals. If, on the other hand, competition is
good, then it should be restored where it can be restored. In the case of
natural monopolies, where it is impossible for competition to exist, the
government would administer the monopolies, not on the ground that
competition is undesirable, but on the ground that in such cases it is
impossible.</p>

<p>Those who believe that the right is sure of ultimate triumph will
watch the struggle in Germany and profit by the lessons taught. I am
inclined to believe that political considerations are so mingled with economic
theories that it is difficult as yet to know just what proportion of
the three million socialist voters believe in "the government ownership
and operation of all the means of production and distribution." The old
age pension act was given as a sop to the socialists, but it strengthened
rather than weakened their contentions and their party. It remains to be
seen whether the new concessions which they seem likely to secure will
still further augment their strength. The Germans are a studious and a
thoughtful people and just now they are absorbed in the consideration
of the aims and methods of the socialist movement (mingled with a
greater or less amount of governmental reform), and the world awaits
their verdict with deep interest.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LVI.</h2>

<h3>RUSSIA AND HER CZAR.</h3>


<p>The map of Russia makes the other nations of Europe look insignificant
by comparison. Moscow is called "The Heart of Russia,"
and yet the trans-Siberian railway from Moscow to Vladivostok is
about 6,000 miles long, nearly one-fourth the circumference of the
globe. From St. Petersburg to Sebastopol is more than 2,000 miles,
and yet Russia's territory extends much further north than St. Petersburg
and much further south than Sebastopol. In a book recently
issued by authority of the Russian government, some comparisons
are made that give an idea of the immensity of Russia's domain. For
instance, Siberia is about one and one-half times as large as Europe,
25 times as large as Germany, and covers one-thirteenth of the continental
surface of the globe. Besides having great timber belts and
vast prairies, Siberia has a hill and lake region ten times as large as
Switzerland, and it is claimed that some of the lakes are as beautiful
as those of "The Mountain Republic." Lately the government has
been encouraging immigration into the country opened up by the
trans-Siberian railway and the success of the movement is shown by
the fact that the number of passengers carried on the western section
of the road increased from 160,000 in 1896 to 379,000 in 1898, and
on the middle section from 177,000 in 1897 to 476,000 in 1898, with
a similar increase in freight traffic. The government gives a certain
area of land to each settler and, when necessary, advances sufficient
money to build homes and barns for the storage of crops and for the
purchase of agricultural implements. The territorial greatness of
Russia is the first thing that impresses the tourist, and the second is
that it is as yet so sparsely settled that it can without fear of crowding
accommodate a vast increase in population.</p>

<p>Russia embraces all varieties of climate and resources.</p>

<p>My journey was confined to the northwest portion. I entered the
country below Warsaw, went east to Moscow, then north to St.
Petersburg and thence southwest to Berlin. This, with the exception
of my visit to Tula, gave me my only opportunity to see the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span>
of Russia. They impressed me as being a hardy race and the necessities
of climate are such as to compel industry and activity. I never
saw elsewhere such universal preparation for cold weather. As yet
Russia is almost entirely agricultural, but manufacturing enterprises
are continually increasing. The peasants live in villages and for the
most part hold their lands in common&mdash;that is, the lands belong to
the commune or village as a whole and not to the individual. When
Alexander freed the serfs the land was sold to them jointly on long-time
payments. These payments have in only a few instances been
completed, wherefore not many of the peasants own land individually.
There is just now much discussion in Russia about the method of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span>
holding land. Some contend that communal holding tends to discourage
thrift and enterprise, and there is some agitation in favor of
individual ownership.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="czar" id="czar"></a>
<img src="images/ill241.jpg" width="450" height="549" alt="czar" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE CZAR OF RUSSIA</p></div>
</div>

<p>Moscow, the largest city of Russia, has a trifle larger population
than St. Petersburg, the capital, which has more than a million.
Moscow, which is the commercial center of the empire, gives the casual
visitor a much better idea of the characteristic life and architecture
of Russia than does St. Petersburg. St. Petersburg, however, is laid
out upon a broader, more generous plan, has wider streets, more impressive
public buildings and private residences, and there is more
evidence of wealth in the capital than in the commercial center. Both
cities possess admirable museums and art galleries. The chief gallery
of Moscow devotes nearly all its wall space to pictures by Russian
artists, and they are sufficient in number to prove Russia's claim to an
honorable place in the world of art.</p>

<p>The Hermitage at St. Petersburg, which is an annex of the emperor's
palace, contains an extraordinary number of masterpieces of
modern and ancient art. The museum of the academy of sciences
possesses a remarkable collection of fine specimens, of prehistoric
animals, among them mammoths, the largest and best preserved of
which was found only a few years ago at the foot of a Siberian glacier.</p>

<p>The visitor to Russia comes away with conflicting emotions. He is
impressed by the wonderful possibilities of the country, but is oppressed
by the limitations and restrictions which the government
places upon individual action and activity. As soon as the traveler
reaches the border of Russia his passport is demanded. It is again
demanded the moment he arrives at his hotel, and it is demanded
and inspected at every place he stops. When he is about to leave the
country he must send his passport to the police office and have it
indorsed with official permission to depart. Not only is a passport
demanded at every place from the foreigner, but native Russians,
high and low, must also bear passports and be prepared to submit
them for inspection upon demand. Not even officers of the army
are exempt from this rigid rule.</p>

<p>The censorship over the press and over private mail is very strict.
I brought away with me a copy of Stead's Review of Reviews which
had been posted to a subscriber in Russia and which had passed
through the hands of the censor. Its pages bore abundant evidence
of the care with which he scrutinized foreign publications, for objectionable
cartoons, articles and even paragraphs had been made illegible
by an obliterating stamp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span></p>

<p>The government of Russia, as the world knows, is an autocracy.
All power is vested in the emperor, and all authority emanates from
him. Being an autocracy, Russia has, of course, no legislative body,
such as is now a part of the government of nearly every civilized
country on the globe. It has not trial by jury and it knows not the
writ of habeas corpus. The custom of exiling or banishing, without
trial, persons objectionable to the government is still practiced. A
large number of Finns, many of them persons of prominence, have
been deported from Finland since the decree of 1899, which limited
the self government which the Finns had enjoyed since Russia annexed
their country.</p>

<p>While in St. Petersburg I was, by the courtesy of the American ambassador,
Mr. McCormick, given an opportunity of meeting and chatting
with the czar of all the Russias, Emperor Nicholas II. I found
him at his winter residence, the palace of Tsarskoe Selo, which is
about an hour's ride from St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>Of all the emperor's palaces, Tsarskoe Selo is his favorite. It
stands in a magnificent park which, at this time of year, is covered with
snow. The emperor is a young man, having been born in 1868. He is
not more than five feet seven or eight inches in height, and apparently
weighs about 160 pounds. His figure is slender and erect, his face
boyish and his eyes a light blue. His hair, which is blonde, is cut
rather short and combed upward over the forehead. The czar wears
a mustache and short beard. The general expression of his face is
gentle, rather than severe, and he speaks English perfectly. He informed
me that about 65 per cent of the adult men of Russia can
read and write and that the number is increasing at the rate of about
3 per cent a year. This increase, the czar said, was shown by the
recruits to the army, and as these come from all provinces of the empire
and all classes of society, he believes it to be a fair test of the
people as a whole. The czar declares himself deeply interested in
the spread of education among the people and seemed to realize that
opportunities for education should be extended to men and women
equally. I referred to a decree issued by him about a year ago promising
a measure of self-government to the local communities. The
czar said: "Yes, that was issued last February, and the plan is now
being worked out." He manifested great gratification at the outcome
of the proposals submitted by him, which resulted in the establishment
of The Hague court of arbitration, and it is a movement
of which he may justly feel proud, for while it is not probable that
The Hague tribunal will at once end all wars, it is certain to contribute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span>
largely to the growth of a sentiment that will substitute the
reign of reason for the rule of brute force. The czar spoke warmly
of the friendly relations that have existed for years between Russia
and the United States. He said that the people of his country had
rejoiced in the growth and greatness of the United States. Then,
speaking with considerable feeling, the czar said: "The attitude of
Russia in the Kischineff affair has been very much misrepresented
by some of the newspapers and I wish you would tell your people so
when you return to the United States."</p>

<p>The Russian officials deny that the government was in any way
responsible for the massacre and I was informed that the government
had caused the prosecution and secured the imprisonment of
many of those implicated. The emperor showed in his conversation
that he respected public opinion in the United States and was anxious
that his administration should not rest under condemnation. It seems
to be the general opinion of those with whom I had a chance to speak
in Russia that the emperor himself is much more progressive and
liberal than his official environment. If he were free to act upon
his own judgment, it is believed that he would go further and faster
than the officeholding class surrounding him in broadening the foundations
of government, and from his words and manner during my
conversation with him I am inclined to share this opinion.</p>

<p>What Russia most needs today are free speech and a free press&mdash;free
speech that those who have the welfare of the country at heart
may give expression to their views and contribute their wisdom to
that public opinion which, in all free countries, controls to a greater
or less extent those who hold office. To deny freedom of speech is
to question the ability of truth to combat error; it is to doubt the
power of right to vindicate itself. A free press would not only enable
those in office to see their actions as others see them, but would exercise
a wholesome restraint. Publicity will often deter an official from
wrong-doing when other restraints would be insufficient, and those
who are anxious to do well ought to welcome anything that would
throw light upon their path. With free speech and a free press it
would not be long before the participation of the Russian people in
government would be enlarged, and, with that enlarged share in the
control of their own affairs, would come not only contentment, but
the education which responsibility and self-government bring. It is
impossible to prepare people for self-government by depriving them
of the exercise of political rights. As children learn to walk by being
allowed to fall and rise and fall and rise again, so people profit by
experience and learn from the consequences of their mistakes.</p>

<p>That the Russian people are devoted to their church is evident everywhere.
Every village and town has its churches, and the cities have
cathedrals, chapels and shrines seemingly innumerable. St. Isaac's
cathedral in St. Petersburg is an immense basilica and is ornamented
in nave and transept with precious and semi-precious stones. The
superb portico is supported by a maze of granite monoliths seven
feet in diameter. There is now in process of construction at Moscow
a still more elaborate cathedral. Russia is not a good missionary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span>
field for two reasons: First, because the people seem wedded to their
church, and, second, because no one is permitted to sever his connection
with the church.</p>

<p>The child of an orthodox Russian becomes a member of the church
of his parents and if he desires to enter another church he must
leave the country. If one of the orthodox church marries a member
of another church the children must of necessity be reared in the
Russian faith. It will be seen, therefore, that the church is very
closely connected with the government itself, and quite as arbitrary.</p>

<p>De Tocqueville some fifty years ago predicted a large place for
Russia among the nations of Europe and my visit to the great empire
of the northeast convinced me that Russia, with universal education,
freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion and constitutional
self-government, would exert an influence upon the destinies
of the old world to which it would be difficult to set a limit.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LVII.</h2>

<h3>ROME&mdash;THE CATHOLIC CAPITAL.</h3>


<p>The dominant feature of Rome is the religious feature, and it is
fitting that it should be so, for here the soil was stained with the
blood of those who first hearkened to the voice of the Nazarene&mdash;here
a cruel Nero lighted his garden with human torches, little thinking
that the religion of those whom he burned would in time illumine the
earth.</p>

<p>The fact that the city is the capital of the Catholic world is apparent
everywhere. All interest is centered in the Vatican and St. Peter's.
The civil government of Italy extends to the nation's borders, but
the papal authority of Rome reaches to the remotest corners of the
earth. I was anxious to see the man upon whom such vast responsibility
rests, and whose words so profoundly influence millions of the
human race. Lord Denbigh, of England, had given me a letter of
introduction to Cardinal Merry del Val, the papal secretary of state,
and armed with this I visited the Vatican. Cardinal del Val is an
exceedingly interesting man. He was born of Spanish parents, but
one of his grandparents was English, and he is connected by ties
of blood with several families of the English nobility. He was educated
in England, and speaks that language fluently and without
an accent, as he does French, German, Italian and Spanish. His linguistic
accomplishments are almost as great as those of the famous
Cardinal Mezzofanti. Cardinal del Val is an unusually young man
to occupy such an important post&mdash;he is not yet forty. He impresses
one as a man of rare ability and he possesses extraordinary versatility
and a diplomatic training that will make him eminently useful to His
Holiness. The papal secretary of state is a tall, slender, distinguished-looking
man. His intellectual face is thin and oval; his eyes are
large, dark and brilliant, showing his Spanish birth. He received
us in his private apartments in the Vatican. They are among the
most interesting of the 1,200 rooms in that great building and were
once occupied by that famous pope who was a Borgia. The ceilings
and walls down to the floor are painted magnificently, the decoration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[550]</a></span>
having been done by the hand of a master artist of Borgia's reign.
For centuries the suite now occupied by Cardinal del Val had been
part of the Vatican library. The beautiful walls were once hidden by
a coat of rude whitewash, but the paintings were discovered not long
ago and restored once more to view.</p>

<p>Before visiting the Vatican I called upon Monsignor Kennedy, the
rector of the American college. Monsignor Kennedy is a learned
and an exceedingly agreeable American and under his efficient management
the number of students in the college has been doubled within
a few years. He enabled me to meet Pope Pius' Maestro di Camera.
By the good offices of Cardinal del Val and the Maestro di Camera, it
was arranged that I should have a private audience with the Holy
Father the following day, Monsignor Kennedy acting as interpreter.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="coliseum" id="coliseum"></a>
<img src="images/ill244.jpg" width="450" height="260" alt="coliseum" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">COLISEUM, ROME.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Pope Pius received us in his private room adjoining the public
audience chamber, where distinguished Catholics from all over
the world were collected and ready to be presented and receive
the papal blessing. The private audience room is a rather small
apartment, simply, but beautifully furnished and decorated. A
throne bearing the papal crown occupied one side of the room. His Holiness
greeted us very courteously and cordially. He wore a long white
cassock, with a girdle at the waist; the fisherman's ring was on his
finger and he wore a small, closely fitting skull-cap of white. I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a><br /><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span>
an opportunity to study his face. It is a round, strong face, full of
kindliness and benevolence, but there are not lacking indications
that its possessor has a purpose and will of his own. The face is ruddy
and the nose rather long&mdash;it is straight and not arched. His eyes are
large, blue and friendly. The scant hair visible below the skull-cap is
white. In stature the Holy Father is about five feet nine or ten
inches and his figure is sturdy, but not too heavy. His step is light
and gives an impression of strength and good health.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 381px;"><a name="pius" id="pius"></a>
<img src="images/ill245.jpg" width="381" height="600" alt="pius" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">POPE PIUS X.</p></div>
</div>

<p>His Holiness has already gained a reputation as a democratic pontiff
and enjoys a large and growing popularity with the people. He is
an orator and often on Sunday goes into one of the many court yards
of the Vatican and preaches to the crowds that gather quite informally.
His gestures are said to be graceful and his voice melodious. His
manner is earnest and his thoughts are expressed in clear and emphatic
language. There is a feeling in Rome that Pius X. is going
to be known in history as a reformer&mdash;not as a reformer of doctrine,
but as one who will popularize the church's doctrine with a view to
increasing the heartiness and zeal of the masses in the application of
religious truth to everyday life.</p>

<p>I assured his Holiness that I appreciated the opportunity that was
his to give impetus to the moral forces of the world, and he replied:
"I hope my efforts in that direction will be such as to merit commendation."
Answering my statement that I called to present the good
will of many Catholic friends as well as to pay my respects, His
Holiness asked me to carry his benediction back to them.</p>

<p>If I may venture an opinion upon such brief observation, it is that
heart characteristics will dominate the present pontiff's course. He
is not so renowned a scholar and diplomat as was his predecessor, nor
is he so skilled in statecraft, but he is a virile, energetic, practical
religious teacher, charitable, abounding in good works and full of
brotherly love. I am confident that he will play an important part
in the world-wide conflict between man and mammon.</p>

<p>The world has made and is making great progress in education and
in industry. The percentage of illiteracy is everywhere steadily decreasing.
The standards of art and taste are rising and the forces of
nature are being harnessed to do the work of man. Steam, madly
escaping from its prison walls, turns myriad wheels and drags our
commerce over land and sea, while electricity, more fleet of foot than
Mercury, has become the message-bearer of millions. Even the waves
of the air are now obedient to the command of man and intelligence is
flashed across the ocean without the aid of wires. With this dominion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span>
over nature man has been able to advance his physical well-being, as
well as to enlarge his mental horizon, but has the moral development
of the people kept pace with material prosperity? The growing antagonism
between capital and labor, the lack of sympathy often
manifest between those of the same race and even of the same religion,
when enjoying incomes quite unequal&mdash;these things would seem
to indicate that the heart has lagged behind the head and the purse.
The restoration of the equilibrium and the infusing of a feeling of
brotherhood that will establish justice and good will must be the
aim of those who are sincerely interested in the progress of the race.
This is pre-eminently the work of our religious teachers, although it
is a work in which the laity as well as the clergy must take part.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="naples" id="naples"></a>
<img src="images/ill246.jpg" width="450" height="322" alt="naples" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">NAPLES</p></div>
</div>

<p>After meeting Pius X., late the beloved patriarch of Venice, I feel
assured that he is peculiarly fitted to lead his portion of the Christian
church in this great endeavor.</p>

<p>The Vatican, which serves as the home and executive offices of the
supreme pontiff of the Catholic church, is an enormous building, or
rather collection of buildings, for it bears evidence of additions and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span>
annexes. One might be easily lost in its maze of corridors. The
ceilings of the chief apartments are high and, like the walls of the
spacious rooms and halls, are covered with frescoes of priceless value.
The Vatican adjoins St. Peter's cathedral&mdash;or basilica as it is called&mdash;a
description of whose beauties would fill a volume. The basilica is
so harmoniously proportioned that one does not appreciate its vastness
from a distance, but once within its walls it is easy to credit
the statement that fifty thousand persons can be crowded into it. In
a crypt just beneath the great dome is the tomb of St. Peter, about
which myriad lamps are kept constantly burning. Near the tomb is
a crucifix suspended under a canopy supported by four spiral columns
that are replicas of a column elsewhere in the cathedral that is said
to have been part of Solomon's temple. Not far from the crucifix is the
famous bronze statue of St. Peter, made from a pagan statue of Jupiter.
It is mounted upon a pedestal about five feet high and the large toe of
the right foot, which projects over the pedestal has been worn smooth
by the lips of devout visitors to the basilica.</p>

<p>To me the most remarkable of the splendors of the cathedral were
the mosaic pictures, of which there are many of heroic size. These
mosaics depict Bible scenes and characters and are done with such
marvelous skill that a little way off one can hardly doubt that they
are the product of the brush of some great master. The colors, tints
and shades are so perfect that it is difficult to believe that the pictures
are formed by the piecing together of tiny bits of colored marbles
and other stones. The Vatican maintains a staff of artists in mosaic,
some of whose work may be purchased by the public. I was shown
the masterpiece of Michael Angelo in the cathedral of St. Peter in
Vinculo&mdash;a statue of Moses, seated. In the right knee there is a slight
crack visible and it is tradition that, when the great sculptor had
finished his work, he struck the knee with his mallet in a burst of
enthusiasm and exclaimed, "Now, speak." St. Paul's cathedral, which
stands outside the ancient wall of the city, is of modern construction
and is therefore less interesting to the visitor than the great basilica
of St. Peter's.</p>

<p>Next to the Vatican and the cathedrals in interest are the ruins of
ancient Rome. In England and France I had seen buildings many
centuries old; in Rome one walks at the foot of walls that for nearly
two thousand years have defied the ravages of time. The best preserved
and most stupendous of the relics of "The Eternal City" is the
Colosseum. It is built upon a scale that gives some idea of the largeness
of Roman conceptions and of the prodigality with which the
emperors expended the money and labor of the people. The arena<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a><br /><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span>
in which the gladiators fought with their fellows and with wild beasts&mdash;the
arena in which many of the Christian martyrs met their death&mdash;is
slightly oval in form, the longest diameter being about 250 feet.
The arena was so arranged that it could be flooded with water and
used for aquatic tournaments. The spectators looked down upon the
contests from galleries that rose in four tiers to a height of 150 feet.
At one end of the arena was the tribune occupied by the emperor and
his suite; at the other end the vestal virgins occupied another tribune
and it was their privilege to confer either life or death upon the vanquished
gladiators by turning the thumb up or down&mdash;turned up it
meant life, turned down, death. The Roman populace gained access
to the galleries by 160 doors and stairways. The seating capacity of
the Colosseum is estimated to have been fifty thousand.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><a name="venice" id="venice"></a>
<img src="images/ill247.jpg" width="600" height="351" alt="venice" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">GRAND CANAL&mdash;VENICE</p></div>
</div>

<p>The Forum is even richer than the Colosseum in historic interest
and recent excavations have brought to light what are supposed to be
the tomb of Cæsar and the tomb of Romulus. The tribune is pointed
out from which the Roman orators addressed the multitude. Here
Cicero hurled his invectives at Cataline and Mark Antony is by
Shakespeare made to plead here for fallen Cæsar. The triumphal
arch of Constantine stands at one end of the Forum and is in an
excellent state of preservation. Among the carvings lately exhumed
are some (especially attractive to an agriculturist) showing the forms
of the bull, the sheep and the hog. They are so like the best breeds
of these animals to-day that one can scarcely believe they were chiseled
from stone nearly twenty centuries ago. In Rome, as in Paris, there
is a Pantheon in the familiar style of Greek architecture. In the
Roman Pantheon is the tomb of Raphael. Cardinal Bembo, in recognition
of Raphael's genius, caused to be placed upon his tomb a Latin
epitaph which Hope has translated:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Living, great nature feared he might outvie</span>
<span class="i1">Her works, and dying fears herself to die."</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>To those who are familiar with Roman history the river Tiber is
an object of interest, but here, as is often the case, one feels disappointed
in finding that the thing pictured was larger than the reality.
The Tiber, yellow as the Missouri, flows through the very heart of
Rome and is kept within its channel by a high stone embankment.
In and near Rome are many ancient palaces, some of them falling into
decay, and some well preserved. One of the most modern of the palaces
of the Italian nobles was built by American money, the wife being
a member of a wealthy New York family. Part of this palace is now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[557]</a><br /><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[558]</a></span>
occupied by the American ambassador, Mr. Myer, to whom I am indebted
for courtesies extended in Rome. Art galleries and museums
are numerous in Rome and in the other cities of Italy, and contain
many of the works of the great Italian artists like Raphael, Angelo,
Titian and others. The palace of King Victor Emmanuel and the
public buildings of Rome are imposing, but do not compare in size
or magnificence with the ancient palaces of England and France. The
journey from Rome to Venice carried us through a very fertile part
of Italy. The land is carefully cultivated; the thrifty farmers in some
places have set out mulberry trees for the cultivation of the silk worm
and have trained grape vines upon the trees.</p>

</div>

<p>We passed through the edge of Venice and saw the gondoliers on
the Grand Canal waiting to carry passengers into the city. A very
intelligent Italian newspaper correspondent whom I met in Rome informed
me that the northern provinces of Italy were much further
advanced in education than the southern provinces, but that the people
of the south were mentally very alert and with the addition of
instruction would soon reach the intellectual level of the north.</p>

world's greatest religious organization.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LVIII.</h2>

<h3>TOLSTOY, THE APOSTLE OF LOVE.</h3>


<p>Count Leo Tolstoy, the intellectual giant of Russia, the moral
Titan of Europe and the world's most conspicuous exponent of the
doctrine of love, is living a life of quiet retirement upon his estate
near the village of Yasnaya, Poliana, about one hundred and thirty
miles south of Moscow.</p>

<p>I made a visit to the home of this pleasant philosopher during
my stay in Russia, driving from Tula in the early morning and
arriving just after daylight. Consul General Smith of Moscow arranged
with Count Tolstoy for the visit. I had intended remaining only a
few hours, but his welcome was so cordial that my stay was prolonged
until near midnight. Count Tolstoy is now about seventy-six years old,
and while he shows the advance of years he is still full of mental vigor
and retains much of his physical strength. As an illustration of the
latter I might refer to the horseback ride and walk which we took
together in the afternoon. The ride covered about four miles and
the walk about two. When we reached the house the count said that
he would take a little rest and insisted that I should do likewise. A
few minutes later, when I expressed to the count's physician, Dr.
Burkenheim, the fear that he might have overtaxed his strength, the
doctor smilingly assured me that the count usually took more exercise,
but had purposely lessened his allowance that day, fearing that he
might fatigue me.</p>

<p>Count Tolstoy is an impressive figure. His years have only slightly
bowed his broad shoulders and his step is still alert. In height he
is about five feet eight, his head is large and his abundant hair is not
yet wholly white. His large blue eyes are set wide apart and are
shaded by heavy eyebrows. The forehead is unusually wide and high.
He wears a long, full beard that gives him a patriarchal appearance.
The mouth is large and the lips full. The nose is rather long and
the nostrils wide. The hands are muscular, and the grasp bespeaks
warmth of heart. The count dresses like the peasants of his country,
wearing a grayish-blue blouse belted in at the waist, with skirts reaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[560]</a></span>
nearly to the boot-tops. His trousers, also of the peasant style, are
inclined to be baggy and are stuffed into his boots. I was informed
that the count never wears any other dress, even when other members
of the family are entertaining guests in evening clothes.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="tolstoy" id="tolstoy"></a>
<img src="images/ill250.jpg" width="450" height="589" alt="tolstoy" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">COUNT TOLSTOY.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The room which I occupied was the one used by the count as a
study in his younger days, and I was shown a ring in the ceiling from
which at the age of forty-eight he planned to hang himself&mdash;a plan
from which he was turned by the resolve to change the manner and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[561]</a></span>
purpose of his life. As is well known, Count Tolstoy is a member
of the Russian nobility and for nearly fifty years led the life of a
nobleman. He early achieved fame as a novelist, his "War and
Peace," which was written when he was but a young man, being considered
one of the literary masterpieces of the century. He sounded
all the "depths and shoals of honor" in the literary and social world;
he realized all that one could wish or expect in these lines, but found
that success did not satisfy the cravings of the inner man. While
he was meditating upon what he had come to regard as a wasted life,
a change came over him, and with a faith that has never faltered
he turned about and entered upon a career that has been unique in
history. He donned the simple garb of a peasant, and, living frugally,
has devoted himself to philosophy and unremunerative work&mdash;that is,
unremunerative from a financial standpoint, although he declares that
it has brought him more genuine enjoyment than he ever knew
before. All of his books written since this change in his life have
been given to the public without copyright, except in one instance,
when the proceeds of "Resurrection" were pledged to the aid of the
Russian Quakers, called Doukhobors, whom the count assisted to emigrate
from their persecution in Russia to western Canada, where they
now reside. As an evidence of the count's complete renunciation of all
money considerations, it is stated that he has declined an offer of
$500,000 for the copyright of the books written by him before his
life current was altered.</p>

<p>My object in visiting him was not so much to learn his views&mdash;for
his opinions have had wide expression and can be found in his
numerous essays&mdash;but it was rather to see the man and ascertain if I
could, from personal contact, learn the secret of the tremendous influence
that he is exerting upon the thought of the world. I am satisfied
that, notwithstanding his great intellect, his colossal strength lies in his
heart more than in his mind. It is true that few have equaled him
in power of analysis and in clearness of statement, while none have
surpassed him in beauty and aptness of illustration. But no one can
commune with him without feeling that the man is like an overflowing
spring&mdash;asking nothing, but giving always. He preaches self-abnegation
and has demonstrated to his own satisfaction that there is more
genuine joy in living for others than in living upon others&mdash;more happiness
in serving than in being served.</p>

<p>The purpose of life, as defined by him, has recently been quoted
by Mr. Ernest Crosby in "The Open Court." It reads as follows:</p>

<p>"Life then is the activity of the animal individuality working
in submission to the law of reason. Reason shows man that happiness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[562]</a></span>
cannot be obtained by a self-life and leaves only one outlet open for
him and that is love. Love is the only legitimate manifestation of life.
It is an activity and has for its object the good of others. When it
makes its appearance the meaningless strife of the animal life ceases."
Love is the dominant note in Count Tolstoy's philosophy. It is not
only the only weapon of defense which he recognizes, but it is the only
means by which he would influence others. It is both his shield and
his sword. He is a deeply religious man, notwithstanding the fact
that he was a few years ago excommunicated by the Russian church. In
one of his essays he has defined religion as follows:</p>

<p>"True religion is a relation, accordant with reason and knowledge,
which man establishes with the infinite life surrounding him, and it is
such as binds his life to that infinity, and guides his conduct."</p>

<p>He not only takes his stand boldly upon the side of spiritual, as
distinguished from material, philosophy, but he administers a rebuke
to those who assume that religious sentiment is an indication of intellectual
weakness or belongs to the lower stages of man's development.
In his essay on "Religion and Morality," to which he referred me for
his opinion on this subject, he says:</p>

<p>"Moreover, every man who has ever, even in childhood, experienced
religious feelings, knows by personal experience that it was evoked
in him, not by external, terrifying, material phenomena, but by an
inner consciousness, which had nothing to do with the fear of the
unknown forces of nature&mdash;a consciousness of his own insignificance,
loneliness and guilt. And, therefore, both by external observation and
by personal experience, man may know that religion is not the worship
of gods, evoked by superstitious fear of the invisible forces of nature,
proper to men only at a certain period of their development; but is
something quite independent either of fear or of their degree of education&mdash;a
something that cannot be destroyed by any development
of culture. For man's consciousness of his finiteness amid an infinite
universe, and of his sinfulness (i. e., of his not having done all he might
and should have done) has always existed and will exist as long as man
remains man."</p>

<p>If religion is an expression of "man's consciousness of his finiteness
amid an infinite universe, and of his sinfulness," it cannot be outgrown
until one believes himself to have reached perfection and to
possess all knowledge, and observation teaches us that those who hold
this opinion of themselves are not the farthest advanced, but simply
lack that comprehension of their own ignorance and frailty which is
the very beginning of progress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[563]</a></span></p>

<p>Count Tolstoy is an advocate of the doctrine of non-resistance. He
not only believes that evil can be overcome by good, but he denies that
it can be overcome in any other way. I asked him several questions
on the subject, and the following dialogue presents his views:</p>

<p>Q. Do you draw any line between the use of force to avenge an
injury already received, and the use of force to protect yourself from
injury about to be inflicted?</p>

<p>A. No. Instead of using violence to protect myself, I ought rather
to express my sorrow that I had done anything that would make anyone
desire to injure me.</p>

<p>Q. Do you draw a line between the use of force to protect a right
and the use of force to create a right?</p>

<p>A. No. That is the excuse generally given for the use of violence.
Men insist that they are simply defending a right, when, in fact, they
are trying to secure something that they desire and to which they are
not entitled. The use of violence is not necessary to secure one's rights;
there are more effective means.</p>

<p>Q. Do you draw any distinction between the use of force to protect
yourself and the use of force to protect someone under your care&mdash;a
child, for instance?</p>

<p>A. No. As we do not attain entirely to our ideals, we might find it
difficult in such a case not to resort to the use of force, but it would not
be justifiable, and, besides, rules cannot be made for such exceptional
cases. Millions of people have been the victims of force and have
suffered because it has been thought right to employ it; but I am now
old and I have never known in all my life a single instance in which a
child was attacked in such a way that it would have been necessary
for me to use force for its protection. I prefer to consider actual
rather than imaginary cases.</p>

<p>I found later that this last question had been answered in a letter
on non-resistance addressed to Mr. Ernest Crosby, in 1896 (included in
a little volume of Tolstoy's Essays and Letters recently published by
Grant Richards, Leicester Square, London, and reprinted by Funk
&amp; Wagnalls of New York). In this letter he says:</p>

<p>"None of us has ever yet met the imaginary robber with the imaginary
child, but all the horrors which fill the annals of history and of
our own times came and come from this one thing&mdash;that people will
believe that they can foresee the results of hypothetical future actions."</p>

<p>When I visited him he was just finishing an introduction to a
biographical sketch of William Lloyd Garrison, his attention having
been called to Garrison by the latter's advocacy of the doctrine of
non-resistance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[564]</a></span></p>

<p>Tolstoy, in one of his strongest essays that he has written&mdash;an essay
entitled "Industry and Idleness"&mdash;elaborates and defends the doctrine
advanced by a Russian named Bondaref, to the effect that each individual
should labor with his hands, at least to the extent of producing
his own food. I referred to this and asked him for a brief statement
of his reasons. He said that it was necessary for one to engage in
manual labor in order to keep himself in sympathy with those who
toil, and he described the process by which people first relieve themselves
of the necessity of physical exertion and then come to look with
a sort of contempt upon those who find it necessary to work with their
hands. He believes that a lack of sympathy lies at the root of most
of the injustice which men suffer at the hands of their fellows. He
holds that it is not sufficient that one can remember a time when he
earned his bread in the sweat of his brow, but that he must continue to
know what physical fatigue means and what drudgery is, in order that
he may rightly estimate his brother and deal with him as a brother.
In addition to this he says that, when one begins to live upon the
labor of others, he is never quite sure that he is earning his living.
Let me quote his language: "If you use more than you produce you
cannot be quite content, if you are a conscientious man. Who can
know how much I work? It is impossible. A man must work as
much as he can with his hands, taking the most difficult and disagreeable
tasks, that is, if he wishes to have a quiet conscience. Mental
work is much easier than physical work, despite what is said to the
contrary. No work is too humble, too disagreeable, to do. No man
ought to dodge work. If I dodge work I feel guilty. There are some
people who think they are so precious that other people must do the
dirty, disagreeable work for them. Every man is so vain as to think
his own work the most important. That is why I try to work with my
hands by the side of workingmen. If I write a book, I cannot be
quite sure whether it will be useful or not. If I produce something
that will support life, I know that I have done something useful."</p>

<p>Tolstoy presents an ideal, and while he recognizes that the best of
efforts is but an approach to the ideal, he does not consent to the lowering
of the ideal itself or the defense of anything that aims at less than
the entire realization of the ideal. He is opposed to what he calls
palliatives, and insists that we need the reformation of the individual
more than the reformation of law or government. He holds that the
first thing to do is to substitute the Christian spirit for the selfish
spirit. He likens those who are trying to make piecemeal progress
to persons who are trying to push cars along a track by putting their
shoulders against the cars. He says that they could better employ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[565]</a></span>
their energy by putting steam in the engine, which would then pull
the cars. And the religious spirit he defines as "such a belief in
God and such a feeling of responsibility to God as will manifest itself
both in the worship of the Creator and in the fellowship with the created."</p>

<p>During the course of conversation he touched on some of the problems
with which the various nations have to deal. Of course he is
opposed to war under all circumstances, and regards the professional
soldier as laboring under a delusion. He says that soldiers, instead of
following their consciences, accept the doctrine that a soldier must
do what he is commanded to do, placing upon his superior officer the
responsibility for the command. He denies that any individual can
thus shift the responsibility for his conduct. In speaking of soldiers,
he expressed an opinion that indicates his hostility to the whole military
system. He said that soldiers insisted upon being tried by military
men and military courts, and added: "That is amusing. I remember
that when that plea was made in a case recently, I retorted
that if that was so, why was not a murderer justified in demanding
a trial at the hands of murderers, or a burglar in demanding trial by
a jury of burglars. That would be on all fours with the other proposition."</p>

<p>He is not a believer in protection, and regards a tariff levied upon
all of the people for the benefit of some of the people as an abuse of
government and immoral in principle. I found that he was an admirer
of Henry George and a believer in his theory in regard to the single tax.</p>

<p>He is opposed to trusts. He says that the trust is a new kind of
despotism and that it is a menace to modern society. He regards the
power that it gives men to oppress their fellows as even more dangerous
than its power to reap great profits.</p>

<p>He referred to some of our very rich men and declared that the
possession of great wealth was objectionable, both because of its influence
over its possessor and because of the power it gave him over his
fellows. I asked him what use a man could make of a great fortune,
and he replied: "Let him give it away to the first person he meets.
That would be better than keeping it." And then he told how a lady
of fortune once asked his advice as to what she could do with her money
(she derived her income from a large manufacturing establishment),
and he replied that if she wanted to do good with her money she might
help her work-people to return to the country, and assist them in buying
and stocking their farms. "If I do that," she exclaimed in dismay,
"I would not have any people to work for me, and my income would
disappear."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[566]</a></span></p>

<p>As all are more or less creatures of environment, Tolstoy's views
upon religion have probably been colored somewhat by his experience
with the Greek church. He has, in some instances, used arguments
against the Greek church which are broad enough to apply to all
church organizations. He has not always discriminated between the
proper use of an organization and the abuse of power which a large
organization possesses. While animated by a sincere desire to hasten
the reign of universal brotherhood, and to help the world to
a realization of the central thought of Christ's teachings, he has not,
I think, fully appreciated the great aid which a church organization
can lend when properly directed. In the work in which Tolstoy is
engaged, he will find his strongest allies among church members to
whom the commandment "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself"
is not merely sound philosophy, but a divine decree. These will work
in the church and through the church, while he stands without raising
his voice to the same God and calling men to the same kind
of life.</p>

<p>His experience with the arbitrary methods of his own government
has led him to say things that have been construed as a condemnation
of all government. He has seen so much violence and injustice
done in the name of government that it is not strange that the
evils of government should impress him more than its possibilities for
good. And yet those who believe that a just government is a blessing
can work with him in the effort to secure such remedial measures as
he asks for in his letter "To the Czar and His Assistants."</p>

<p>Tolstoy's career shows how despotic is the sway of the heart and
how, after all, it rules the world, for while his literary achievements
have been admired, the influence which they have exerted is as nothing
compared with the influence exerted by his philosophy. People enjoy
reading his character sketches, his dialogues and his descriptions of
Russian life, but these do not take hold upon men like his simple
presentation of the doctrine of love, exemplified in his life as clearly
as it is expressed by his pen. Many of his utterances are denied
publication in Russia, and when printed abroad cannot be carried
across the border, and yet he has made such a powerful impression
upon the world that he is himself safe from molestation. He can say
with impunity against his government and against the Greek church
what it would be perilous for others to say, and this very security is
proof positive that in Russia thought inspired by love is, as Carlyle
has declared it to be everywhere, stronger than artillery parks.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LIX.</h2>

<h3>NOTES ON EUROPE.</h3>


<p>In the articles written on the different European nations visited I
confined myself to certain subjects, but there are a number of things
worthy of comment which were not germane to the matters discussed.
I shall present some of these under the above head.</p>

<p>An American who travels in England in the winter time is sure to
notice the coldness of the cars. The English people do not seem to
notice this, for if they did the matter would certainly be remedied;
but the stranger who has to wrap up in blankets and keep his feet upon
a tank of hot water makes comparisons between the comfort of the
American railway cars and those of England, much to the disadvantage
of the latter. On the continent the temperature of the cars is higher
and travel more pleasant.</p>

<p>Sheep graze in the very suburbs of London. This was a surprise
to me. I saw more sheep in the little traveling that I did in England
than I have seen in the United States east of the Mississippi River in
years of travel. But after one has enjoyed for a few days the English
mutton chop, the best in the world, he understands why English sheep
are privileged to graze upon high priced lands.</p>

<p>The House of Lords is much more elegantly furnished than Parliament,
but it excites curiosity rather than interest. It, too, is small
compared with the number of Lords; but as the Lords seldom attend,
the accommodations are ample. Only three members are required to
constitute a quorum, and it is easy therefore to get together enough
to acquiesce in measures that pass Parliament. So far as any real
influence is concerned, the House of Lords might as well be abolished;
and as only three are necessary to constitute a quorum, it would only
be necessary to reduce the necessary number by three and make none
a quorum to entirely remove this legislative body from consideration.</p>

<p>The Courts of England are a matter of interest to American lawyers,
and a matter of curiosity to other Americans. As our Supreme Judges
wear gowns, the gown is not so unfamiliar to us; but the wig, which is
still worn by the English judges, barristers and solicitors, is not seen
in this country. The wig is made of white curly hair and does not
reach much below the ears. "When the wearer has black hair, or red
hair, or in fact hair of any color except, white, the contrast between
the wig and the natural hair sometimes excites a smile from those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[568]</a></span>
who are not impressed with the necessity for this relic of ancient
times. In one of the court rooms which I visited, a son of Charles
Dickens was arguing a case, and while I did not recognize any of the
brilliancy and humor that have led me to place Dickens at the head
of the novelists whom I have read, the son is said to be a reasonably
successful lawyer. In one of the Admiralty Courts a very bushy headed
wharfman was testifying to a salvage contract which he had made and
he was quite emphatic in his assertions that the terms were "'alf and
'alf."</p>

<p>In one of the court rooms Lord Alverstone was presiding, and I
had the pleasure of meeting him afterwards at dinner in Lincoln Inn
Court. He is one of the finest looking men whom I met in England.
He rendered a decision in favor of the United States in the matter of
the recent arbitration with Canada.</p>

<p>Ambassador Joseph Choate placed me under obligations to him, as
did also Secretary of the Legation Henry White, by their many
courtesies extended.</p>

<p>At Mr. Choate's table I had the pleasure of meeting Right Hon. A. J.
Balfour, the present Premier. He strikes one as a scholarly man
rather than as a parliamentary fighter. He has had a remarkable
official career. As he was and is still a bimetallist, I found him a congenial
man to have at my right. Mr. Richie, who left the Cabinet because
of a disagreement with Mr. Balfour on the fiscal question, sat
at my left, and as he was an ardent opponent of protection, I had no
trouble conversing with him. I learned afterwards that Mr. Balfour
and Mr. Richie had not met since the Cabinet rupture. Among those
present at the table was Hon. Leonard Courtney, for many years a
member of Parliament. He was a member of the Royal Commission
that presented the now world renowned report on falling prices. He
also took an active part in opposing the war against the Boers. In
appearance he reminds one of Senator Allen G. Thurman, having
something of the same strength and ruggedness of feature. I am
indebted to him for an opportunity to visit Lincoln Inn Court, where
I met a number of other eminent judges besides Lord Alverstone.</p>

<p>Mr. Moreton Frewen was also a guest of Ambassador Choate on that
occasion. He has frequently visited the United States and has written
much on the subject of silver. When he came to the United States
soon after the election in 1896, and was told that there had been some
repeating in some of the cities, he inquired, "Is it not twice as honest
to vote twice for honest money as to vote once?" I found, however,
that he was working with the Chamberlain protectionists, who, by
the way, call themselves "tariff reformers." He had found a Bible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[569]</a></span>
passage which he was using on the stump. It was taken from Genesis.
Pharaoh said to someone who inquired of him, "Go unto Joseph;
what he saith to you, do." It seems, however, from the more recent
elections, that the people have refused to identify the modern Joseph
with the ancient one.</p>

<p>At Mr. Choate's table the subject of story telling was discussed, and
some comment made about the proverbial slowness of the Englishman
in catching the point of American stories. I determined to test this
with a story and told of the experience of the minister who was arguing
against the possibility of perfection in this life. He asked
his congregation: "Is there anyone here who is perfect?" No one arose.
"Is there anyone in the congregation who has ever seen a perfect
person?" No one arose. Continuing his inquiry, he asked, "Is there
anyone here who has ever heard of a perfect person?" A very meek
little woman arose in the rear of the room. He repeated his question
to be sure that she understood, and as she again declared that she had
heard of such a person, he asked her to give the name of the perfect
person of whom she had heard. She replied, "My husband's first wife."
All the Englishmen at the table saw the point of the story at once,
and one of them remarked that he thought the story would be appreciated
wherever domestic life is known.</p>

<p>It was my good fortune to meet in London Mr. Sidney Webb and
his talented wife, both of whom have written extensively on municipal
ownership and industrial co-operation.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting figures in European journalism is Sir
Alfred Harmsworth, proprietor of the London Daily Mail. He has
achieved a remarkable success and is still a young man. His country
home, some thirty miles out from London, is an old English castle
which he recently secured for a long term of years. The house was
built more than three hundred years ago by one of the kings for a
favorite courtier. The estate is large enough to include farm and
pasture lands and a well stocked hunting preserve. Lady Harmsworth
is one of the most beautiful women in the kingdom and entertains lavishly.</p>

<p>The average foreigner does not have any higher opinion than the
American does of those "international marriages" by means of which
some of the decaying estates of titled foreigners are being restored, but
there are many marriages between our people and Europeans which
rest upon affection and congeniality. The union of Rt. Hon. Joseph
Chamberlain and the daughter of Ex-Secretary Endicott, who was at
the head of the Navy Department during Mr. Cleveland's first administration,
is a notable illustration. Mrs. Chamberlain is a charming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[570]</a></span>
and accomplished woman and justly popular with the Britons as well
as with the Americans who visit England.</p>

<p>The American tourist is sure to find some of his countrymen stranded
in London. I met several of them. Most of them represented themselves
as related to prominent political friends, and these I could assist
without inquiring too closely into the alleged relationship, but one
case of a different kind failed to appeal to me. A lady who attached a
high sounding title to her name sent her secretary to solicit aid. He
represented her as an American who had against her parents' wishes
married a titled Englishman; her husband had deserted her and her
physician had told her that her health required that she spend the
winter in Southern France. Her American relatives were rich, I was
assured, but she was too proud to let them know of her misfortune. It
was a sad story even when told by a secretary (how she could afford
one I do not know), but I did not feel justified in encouraging a pride
that led her to make her wants known to strangers rather than to her
own kin.</p>

<p>In my article on the growth of municipal ownership (it will be
found on another page), I referred to the work of John Burns, the
noted labor leader of London. I may add here that his seven or eight
years old son is the handsomest child that I saw in England. I was
on the stage at Lord Rosebery's meeting and my attention was attracted
to a child of unusual beauty sitting just in front of me. I asked the
gentleman at my side whether he was a fair sample of the English
boy; he replied that he was an excellent representative. Soon afterward
the mother introduced herself to me as the wife of John Burns.
I thought it an interesting coincidence that I should admire the child
unconscious of his relationship to the man who had the day before
impressed me so favorably.</p>

<p>And, speaking of Mr. Burns, I reproduce below an item which appeared
in one of the London papers the day after I returned Mr. Burns'
call. He sent it to me with the remark that it probably differed from
the personal items to which I was accustomed. It reads:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Burns' Mysterious Visitor.</p>

<p>"Just before ten o'clock this (Friday) morning a hansom cab
(plentifully bespattered with gilt coronets) stopped outside the residence
of Mr. Burns, Lavender Hill. A person alighted and was received
with every appearance of cordiality by Mr. Burns, who escorted
him into the house. We believe the visitor was Lord Rosebery; he
certainly bore a striking resemblance to that childlike peer. Possibly,
however, it was only the King of Italy. In diplomatic circles it has
been known for a long time that his Italian Majesty intended to visit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[571]</a></span>
the Municipal Mecca for much the same reasons that induced Peter
the Great of Russia to come to England. It was known, also, that he
would come in some sort of disguise. That Mr. Burns' visitor this
morning was a person of importance is evidenced by the fact that a
constable in uniform and two or three other men (probably secret
service officers) were in waiting when the cab drew up. They stood
round the visitor and the constable saluted respectfully. A uniformed
policeman had been in the neighborhood of Mr. Burns' house
and the 'Crown' all the morning."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Westminster Abbey is one of the places which the visitor cannot
well neglect. It was originally the burial place of royalty, and as the
guide shows you the tablets and statues which perpetuate the memory
of warrior kings and tells you how this king killed that one, and that
king killed another, you recall the story of the American minister
who concluded a very short discourse at the funeral of a man of questionable
character by saying, "Some believe that he was a tolerable
good man, while others believe that he was a very bad man, but whether
he was good or bad we have this consolation, that he is dead." It is
a relief to pass from the bloody annals of the earlier days and from the
bloody deeds of ancient royalty to that part of the building which is
honored by memorials of the great men in modern English life. To
the American the most noted of those recently buried in Westminster
Abbey was Gladstone. His life spanned the present and the past generation,
and his character and talents are regarded as a part of the
heritage of English speaking people.</p>

<p>A description of the Art Gallery, the public buildings, the Tower,
and of the many interesting and historic places would occupy more
space than I can spare at this time.</p>

<p>I shall pass from England with one observation. Upon the streets
of London, and in fact throughout the British Isles, the rule is to "turn
to the left." The American notices this at once, and until he becomes
accustomed to it he is in danger of collision. If England and the
United States ever come together in an unfriendly way, it will probably
be accounted for by the difference in our rules. We will be turning
to the right while she will be turning to the left.</p>

<p>Queenstown, Ireland, the first town to greet the tourist when he
reaches Northern Europe and the last to bid him farewell when he
departs, is a quaint and interesting old place. It is near the City of
Cork, and the names upon the signs&mdash;the Murphys, the McDonalds,
the O'Briens, etc., are so familiar that one might suppose it to be an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[572]</a></span>
American colony. Here the returning traveler has a chance to spend
any change which he has left, for black thorn canes and shillalahs,
"Robert Emmett" and "Harp of Erin" handkerchiefs and lace collars
are offered in abundance. The price of these wares has been known to
fall considerably as the moment of departure approaches. At Queenstown
one can hear the Irish brogue in all its richness and if he takes a
little jaunt about the town he can enjoy the humor for which the
Irish are famed.</p>

<p>Scotland has a hardy population, due probably to the climate. Even
near the southern boundary, the weather was quite wintry before
Thanksgiving Day of last year. Scotch plaids are in evidence at the
stores and the visitor has an opportunity to buy traveling blankets
bearing the figures and the colors of the various Scottish clans. As I
visited Scotland to study municipal ownership I reserved for a future
trip a visit to the places of natural and historic interest.</p>

<p>Strange that a narrow channel should make such a difference as
there is between the Englishman and the Frenchman. Some one has
said, "not only is England an island, but each Englishman is an
island." This puts the case a little too strongly, but one notices that
the French are much more gregarious than the English and more
inclined to sociability. Their attention to strangers while not more
sincere is more marked.</p>

<p>Paris seems to be the favorite place for residence for Americans who
desire to live in Europe. The climate is milder, the attractions are
more numerous and the cooking, it is said, is the best in the world.</p>

<p>The automobile seems to have captured Paris, possibly because of
its many wide streets and boulevards.</p>

<p>While the tipping system may not be worse in France than in other
countries, it is certainly nowhere more fully developed. It is said
that in some of the fashionable restaurants of Paris the tips are so
valuable that the waiters, instead of receiving wages, pay a bonus for
a chance to serve. But all over Europe service of every kind is rewarded
with tips, and a failure to comply with the custom makes the delinquent
a persona non grata. At the hotels all the attendants seem to
get notice of the intended departure of a guest and they line up to
receive a remembrance&mdash;porter, chambermaid, valet, bell-boy, elevator
man, and some whose faces are entirely new to the guest. The cab-drivers
collect the fare fixed by city ordinance and expect a tip besides.
Ten per cent is the amount usually given and anything less fails to
elicit thanks. An Irish jaunting car driver at Queenstown took out
his tip in making change. While the traveler is often tempted to
rebel against the tip system as it is found in Europe, he finally concludes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[573]</a></span>
that he can not reform a continent in one brief visit and submits
with as good grace as possible.</p>

<p>Guides can be found at all the leading hotels and they are well
worth what they charge. They are acquainted with all places of interest,
and can act as interpreters if one wants to make inquiries or
do shopping.</p>

<p>The rivers of Europe which have been immortalized in poetry and
song&mdash;the rivers whose names we learn when as children we study
geography&mdash;are a little disappointing. The Thames at London, the
Seine at Paris, the Tiber at Rome, the Danube at Vienna, the Spree
at Berlin, the Po in northern Italy, and the Rhine are not as large
as fancy has pictured; but the lakes of Switzerland surpass description.</p>

<p>I regretted that I could not visit the Bay of Naples for I never think
of it without recalling the lines:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I care not if</span>
<span class="i2">My little skiff</span>
<span class="i0">Floats swift or slow</span>
<span class="i2">From cliff to cliff.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With dreamful eyes</span>
<span class="i2">My spirit lies</span>
<span class="i0">Under the walls</span>
<span class="i2">Of Paradise.</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Surely it must be a delightfully restful place if it justifies the description
given by the poet.</p>

<p>I was disappointed that I did not have time to see more of Germany.
Berlin was the only city in which I stopped, and the fact that the
holiday festivities were at their height made it difficult to prosecute
any investigation. In another article I have discussed the German
socialistic propaganda, and I shall here content myself with calling
attention to their railroad system. The total railroad mileage at the
end of the year 1900, as reported by the American consul, was 28,601.
Of this mileage private companies owned 2,573, and the federal
government 798, the remainder was owned by the various German states,
some of the states owning but a few miles of line. The ownership of
the railroads by the various states does not in the least interfere with
the operation of the lines. The plan in operation in Germany suggests
the possibility of state ownership in this country as distinguished
from federal ownership.</p>

<p>In Austria I saw for the first time the systematic cultivation of
forests. In some places the various plantings were near enough together
to show trees of all sizes. At one side the trees were but a few
feet in height while those at the other side of the forest were being
converted into fuel.</p>

<p>Vienna, the capital of Austria, is not the "Old Vienna" which
was reproduced at the Chicago World's Fair and at the Buffalo Exposition,
but is a substantial, new, and up-to-date city. The stores exhibit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[574]</a></span>
an endless variety of leather goods, and I found there, as also
in Belgium, many novelties in iron, steel and brass.</p>

<p>Russia deserves more attention than I could give it in the articles
on Tolstoy and the czar. It is a land of wonderful resources and
possibilities, and is making great progress considering the fact that
a large proportion of the population has so recently emerged from
serfdom. The peasants live in villages as in France and their life is
primitive compared with life in the larger cities. There has been
rapid growth in manufacturing, commerce and art. Besides furnishing
one of the greatest of novelists, Tolstoy, who is also the greatest of
living philosophers, Russia has given to the world many others who
are prominent in literature and in art. There is an art gallery at
Moscow devoted almost entirely to the work of Russian artists. Here
one finds a most interesting collection, a large number of the pictures
being devoted to home scenes and historic events. In this gallery the
nude in art is noticeable by its absence. In the art gallery at St.
Petersburg most of the paintings are by foreign artists. There is in
this gallery a wonderful collection of cameos, jewelry and precious
stones.</p>

<p>I found in Russia a very friendly feeling toward the United States.
Prince Hilkoff, who is at the head of the Siberian railroad, speaks
English fluently, as do nearly all the other prominent officials. He
informed me that he visited the United States about 1858 and crossed
the plains by wagon. He inquired about the Platte river and its
branches and remembered the names of the forts along the route.</p>

<p>I have spoken in another article of the deep hold which the Greek
Church has upon the people of Russia. A story which I heard in St.
Petersburg illustrates this. An American residing there asked her
cook to go to market after some pigeons, or doves as they are more
often called. The latter was horrified at the thought and refused, saying,
"The Holy Ghost descended upon our Saviour in the form of a dove
and it might be in one of these." Another American was rebuked
by her servant, who when told to throw something out of the window
replied, "This is Easter and Christ is risen. He might be passing by
at this moment."</p>

<p>In Russia we find the extremes. The government is the most arbitrary
known among civilized nations and yet in Russia are to be
found some of the most advanced and devoted advocates of civil liberty.
Nowhere is the doctrine of force more fully illustrated and yet from
Russia come the strongest arguments in favor of non-resistance. The
poison and the antidote seem to be found near together in the world
of thought as well as in the physical world.</p>
